1. Introduction

 We have compiled this version of Grace on VMS version 6.2 and 7.1 with
 DECC version 5.7.  We have allowed for other versions, but may have missed
 some things.  Please send mail to John Hasstedt if you have any problems
 building; include CONFIGURE.LOG in your message.

 Grace calls library functions not included in VMS until version 7.
 Starting with version 5.6 of DECC, Compaq distributes an object library
 (sys$library:decc$crtl.olb) containing these new functions; see
 sys$libray:decc$crtl.readme for information on it.  On VMS version 6
 and older, you can build Grace using this library, or you can build it
 with versions of the needed routines that are [.src]missing.c.  The
 default is to use the decc$crtl library if it exists on VMS version
 6 and older, and to not use it on VMS version 7.

 The build procedure runs a program (buildinfo) to create a header file
 (buildinfo.h) contining information on when and where it is built.  This
 program requires the new routines.  Instead of modifying it to work with
 older versions, I wrote some DCL code to create buildinfo.h.  This code
 is not executed automatically.  If you do not use decc$crtl on version 6
 and older of VMS, you must do @[.ARCH.VMS]BUILD BUILDINFO before building
 with MMK or MMS.

 Grace will not compile with Motif 1.1.  Below is Evgeny's answer to the
 problem report in case there is a guru lurking:

  >(I mean who is using the same OS). Such a guy would definitly be familiar
  >with the issue.

2. Other software

 There are three libraries that can be included with Grace: NetCDF allows
 you to read files in the HDF format; GD allows you to write GIF files;
 and JPEG allows you to write JPEG files.  When you compile the libraries,
 you should use the same floating point format (IEEE, G_FLOAT, or D_FLOAT)
 as you use with Grace.

 You can find the NETCDF package at ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/, including
 precompiled binaries for VAX and Alpha.

 You can get a VMS specific version of GD from
 http://www.decus.de:8080/www/vms/sw/gd.htmlx.  Alternatively, you can get
 the Unix version of GD from http://www.boutell.com/gd/ and comile GD.C,
 GDFONTG.C, GDFONTL.C, GDFONTMB.C, GDFONTS.C, and GDFONTT.C with the command
 CC/FLOAT=<float>/WARNING=(DISABLE=(PTRMISMATCH)) and create the library
 from the objects.  <float> is the floating point format used for Grace.

 You can get the JPEG library from the Ghostscript distribution at
 http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html.  You will need to modify
 makefile.vms to use the floating point format you use with Grace.  There is
 also a precompiled version of the library in the netcdf distribution.  You
 must include GD if you want to include JPEG.

3. Compilation

 In the top directory, do

    @[.ARCH.VMS]CONFIGURE [OPTIONS]

 Then do one of the following:

    MMK
    MMS /IGNORE=WARNING
    @[.ARCH.VMS]BUILD

 MMK is MadGoat's make utility; you can get it from
 ftp://ftp.madgoat.com/madgoat/mmk.zip.

 MMS is Compaq's make utility; the /IGNORE=WARNING is necessary with
 MMS to get the T1 library to build.

 If you don't have either make utility, the BUILD.COM command file will
 compile and link Grace.

 Configure accepts options as parameters on the command line.  Separate
 multiple options with spaces.  Note that you CANNOT put spaces around the
 equal sign.  Configure accepts the following options:

    DECC$CRTL -- Use the DECC$CRTL.OLB library if it exists (see section 1).
      The default is to use the library (if it exists) on systems running
      version 6 and older of VMS.  If you do not use DECC$CRTL on version
      6 or older of VMS, you must first do @[.ARCH.VMS]BUILD BUILDINFO if
      you are building with MMK or MMS.

    NODECC$CRTL -- Do not use the DECC$CRTL.

    DPML -- Use the DPML if it exists.  This option allows you to override
      a NODPML specified in a save file.  DPML is the Digital Portable Math
      Library; it contains hyperbolic trig and other functions.  It does not
      exist on the VAX.  Grace uses the routines in the cephes library if
      you don't have the DPML.

    NODPML -- Do not use the DPML even if the system has it.

    OPTIMIZE -- Use the optimizer when you compile code.  This is the default.
      This option allows you to override a NOOPTIMIZE specified in a save file.

    NOOPTIMIZE -- Compile the code with /NOOPTIMIZE.

    D_FLOAT, G_FLOAT, IEEE -- Specify the type of floating point; the
      default is G on VAX and IEEE on Alpha.  IEEE is not available on
      VAX.  You will get errors about overflow and underflow of some
      constants in [.t1lib.type1]token.c from the T1 library if you use
      D_FLOAT.  However, grace still works (you should use
      MMS/IGNORE=WARNING to compile if you select D_FLOAT).  If you are
      including libraries (NETCDF, GD, and JPEG options), you should
      compile the library using the same floating point you use here.

    HOME="/dev/dir" -- Specify the home directory for grace; it must be
      in Unix format.  You can override this compiled in directory when
      running grace by defining the logical name GRACE_HOME.  The default
      is "", and you have to define the logical name.

    PRINT="print cmd" -- Specify the default print command.  If you don't
      specify a print command, configure will use
        print/name="from Grace"/delete/queue=<queue>
      where <queue> is specified with the QUEUE option.  You should not
      double the quotes in the string: PRINT="print/name="from Grace"..."
      You can override this compiled in command when running by defining
      the logical name GRACE_PRINT_CMD.

    QUEUE="queue" -- This option is ignored if you include the PRINT
      option.  The default is decw$printer_format_ps.  Note that the
      string you specify is appended to the string given above, so you
      can add other print qualifiers.  For example,
        QUEUE="psqueue/form=ps"

    EDIT="edit command" -- The command used to open a new window and
      start the text editor.  The default is edit/tpu/interface=motif.
      You can override this compiled in command when running by
      defining the logical name GRACE_EDITOR.

    HELP="browser" -- Specify the command used to start the html browser
      for viewing help; you can override this compiled in command by
      defining the logical name GRACE_HELPVIEWER.  The default is mosaic.
      A %s indicates where the URL should be added; if you omit it, " %s"
      will be added to the end.  There is a command file,
      [.arch.vms]netscape.com, that you can use with netscape.  When you
      select help, this command file will start netscape if it is not
      already running; otherwise, it will display the new help in a new
      window using the existing netscape process.  To use it, you
      need to specify HELP="@dev:[dir]netscape.com %s"; you cannot use
      GRACE_HOME: instead of the device and directory because GRACE_HOME
      is defined in Unix format.

    NETCDF=<header>=<libraries> -- Include the netcdf library.  <header>
      is the directory containing the netcdf header files.  <libraries> is
      a list of the netcdf object libraries, separated by commas.

    GD=<header>=<library> -- Include the GD library for GIF.  <header>
      is the directory containing the GD header files.  <library> is the
      GD object library.  The default library is libgd.olb in the <header>
      directory; you can omit the second equal sign if you use the default.

    JPEG=<header>=<library> -- Include the JPEG library.  <header> is the
      directory containing the JPEG header files.  <library> is the JPEG
      object library.  The default library is libjpeg.olb in the <header>
      directory; you can omit the second equal sign if you use the default.
      You must include the GD library if you want to include the JPEG library.

    COPY -- Copy the build files from [.arch.vms] to the other directories
      even if the files already exist in the other directories.  This option
      is used when debugging the build procedures to make sure the version in
      the other directories is the same as the version in [.arch.vms].

    SAVE -- Save the command line parameters in [.arch.vms]saved.dat.  If
      this file exists when you execute configure.com, configure.com reads
      the file and processes the parameters in it before processing the
      command line parameters.  If you specify the SAVE option and saved.dat
      exists, the new command line parameters are appended to the file; if
      you specify a parameter that is already in the save file, the original
      parameter will remain in the file, but the new parameter will override
      it.  For example, if you run configure with parameters QUEUE="psprinter"
      and SAVE, in future runs of configure.com, QUEUE will default to
      psprinter.  However, any value for QUEUE on the command line will
      override this, and if you specify QUEUE and SAVE on a later run, the
      new value of QUEUE will override the old one.  You can also edit
      saved.dat to add or delete parameters.  The file is just the parameters
      you specify on the command line, one on each line of the file.

 Configure displays the versions and parameters it is using for the build
 and writes this information to configure.log.

4. Installation

 To run, you need the files in [.doc] and [.fonts...], and
 [.templates]default.agr.  You probably want the files in [.examples].
 These directories should be subdirectories of the home directory.

 Define a symbol for the executable:

  $ xmgrace :== $disk:[path]xmgrace

 Define the following logicals if necessary:

  $ define GRACE_HOME "/disk/dir1/dir2/grace"
  ! The path to the directory containing [.doc], [.fonts], and [.templates]
  ! in Unix format.  See the description of the HOME= option above.

  $ define GRACE_PRINT_CMD
  ! See the description of the PRINT= option above.

  $ define GRACE_EDITOR
  ! See the description of the EDIT= option above.

  $ define GRACE_HELPVIEWER "www-browser %s"
  ! See the description of the HELP= option above.

 X-resources:

  The file [.SRC]XMGRACE.AD contains the x resources.  You may want to
  copy this file to XMGRACE.DAT in either DECW$SYSTEM_DEFAULTS and/or
  DECW$USER_DEFAULTS to customize the program.

5. Testing

  $ set default [.examples]
  $ @dotest

 Click exit after each test to display the next test.

6. Other routines

 Grace_np is a library for interfacing with Grace using pipes.  I have
 not yet gotten it to work on VMS.  I have included my notes in case
 someone wants to work on it.

 I had to modify grace_np.c: I changed the call to execlp to execl; and
 I changed the first parameter of the call to execl to the complete
 file specification ("/dev/dir/xmgrace.exe").  I couldn't get it to
 work with logical names or symbols.  I then compiled with

    $ CFLAGS = "/INCLUDE=[-]/PREFIX=ALL"
    $ DEFINE/NOLOG DECC$CRTLMAP SYS$LIBRARY:DECC$CRTL.EXE
    $ CC'CFLAGS' TEST_NP
    $ CC'CFLAGS' GRACE_NP
    $ LINK TEST_NP,GRACE_NP,SYS$LIBRARY:DECC$CRTL.OLB/LIBRARY
    $ RUN TEST_NP

 The DEFINE and including DECC$CRTL.OLB on the link are not necessary
 on VMS version 7.  TEST_NP will run Grace as a subprocess, but is not
 able to pass any commands to it.

 GRCONVERT is a program to convert the binary projects from older versions
 of XMGR to ascii format.  It needs RPC routines included with TCPIP
 software.  If you need it, there is a descrip.mms file in the directory.
 The default is to compile with D floating point; use /MACRO=(FLOAT=<float>)
 to compile with either G_FLOAT or IEEE format.  The default is for systems
 running UCX.  I have added code to descrip.mms so you can use
 /MACRO=(MULTINET=1) to compile with multinet; however, there are errors
 about undefined symbols when linking, so you will need to do some
 debugging if you need this.
