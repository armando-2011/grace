In order to compile Grace, you'll need Cygnus's GNU-win32 development kit 
(ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/gnu-win32/), version B20.1 or above,
and Arlindo da Silva's port of XWindows libs, which can be found at 
http://dao.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/grads/win32/X11R6.4/, or, alternatively,
you can use a commercial X/Motif SDK for Win32.

Of course, you'll need an X server for Windows, too; for a comprehensive list,
see http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.html
