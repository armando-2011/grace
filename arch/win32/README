In order to compile Grace, you'll need Cygnus's GNU-win32 development kit 
(ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/gnu-win32/) and Arlindo da Silva's
port of XWindows libs, which can be found at 
http://dao.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/grads/win32/X11R6.3/. Of course,
you'll need some X server, too; pointers to some free and commercial
X servers can be found in the above package.

Alternatively, you can use a commercial X/Motif SDK for Win32, like eXceed's.

b19 of the GNU-win32 kit lacks the dlfcn.h header. It's included here; move
it to the "src" directory before the compilation.
