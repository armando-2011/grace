1) Introduction
   ------------

  This is (xm)grace compiled for OS/2. Since it's an X11 application
  (well, most of the time and therefore the lon or executable name "xmgrace")
  it requires XFree86 to be installed.
  Like every piece of software this port of Grace may have
  some bugs. Some of them are just related to the general problems
  un*x based applications have on non-un*x filesystems. So read the
  documentation and FAQs of XFree86 carefully to get some hints how to
  avoid running into these bugs/limitations, e.g. it is a good idea to
  install TVFS, the Toronto Virtual File System.

  A pre-compiled version should always be available from

    http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/os2stuff.html

  This document describes only the OS/2 specifics. If you're going
  to use Grace you should read the general documentation files as well!


2) How to build Grace
   --------------------
   
  Here I try to give a complete list what you need to build Grace.
  The first listed packages have be installed in any case:

  - EMX 0.9d development package
      http://hobbes.nmsu.edu, http://www.leo.org

  - XFree86 for OS/2, including its development package(s)
      http://borneo.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86os2.html

  - LessTif for XFree/2 (including Xbae)
      http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/lesstif.html
      
  - t1lib for XFree/2
      http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/tools.html


  Additional useful utilities:

  - the "usual" GNU utilities (text, shell, file).
  - un*x shell (sh)

  To build Grace I use additional libraries which are not integral parts
  of Grace, in fact it can be built without using them.
  If you can't find them on my webpage, I'll provide them upon request.
  See the FAQ where to find the sources for these.

    - libhelp and it's little application xmhelp
                    display the online help written in HTML)
    - libpng:       create PNG files
    - pdflib:       create PDF files
    - fftw library: Fast Fourier transformations

  By now the supplied configure script may not work under OS/2
  (even using the existing Autoconf port). As a small replacement I offer
  a small REXX-script 'configos2.cmd' which should

    - copy standard OS/2 configuration files (config.h and Make.conf)
      from .\arch\os2 to the toplevel source directory
    - build dlfcn.a in \arch\os2 (support for user-supplied mathematical
      functions in dynamic load libraries AKA DLLs)
    - build the complete package

  configos2.cmd is located in .\arch\os2 and has to be copied
  to the toplevel source directory before executing it.
  Please check .\arch\os2\config.h.os2 and .\arch\os2\Make.conf.os2
  and modify them if necessary. Especially make changes to
  make use of pre-installed versions of libraries like
  T1lib and fftw.
  Finally 'x11make.exe' will be called by this script. 
  Note that calling the 'make' script from XFree/2 won't work,
  because the generic Makefile is using shell commands which are 
  disabled by "make.cmd".


3) How to install
   ---------------

  At this moment the OS/2 Makefiles don't offer an installation target.
  You have to do it manually ...

  The binary distribution archive can just be unpacked and will
  fit in the tree below $(X11ROOT)\. I supply a small REXX-script 
  'xmgrace1.cmd' which sets up the necessary environment variable(s)
  so that xmgrace can run within this setup.
  
  A major remaining problem is how to access installed printers without
  manual processing the Postscript files. But this is not only tied to Grace
  but of every non-PM application on OS/2. I'm using lpr and lpd to access
  my local Postscript printer.
  Check out the printing tools on LEO/Hobbes for useful utiities or
  just print to a file and do the further processing (e.g. running 
  Ghostview/gvpm) manually. In future
    http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/printing.html
  might contain useful hints as well.
