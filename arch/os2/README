1) Introduction
   ------------

  Like every piece of software this port of GRACE for XFree86 OS/2 may have
  some bugs. Some of them are just related to the general problems
  un*x biased applications have on non-un*x filesystems. So read the
  documentation and FAQs of XFree86 carefully to get some hints how to
  avoid running into these bugs ('limitations'). e.g. it is a good idea to
  install TVFS, the Toronto Virtual File System.

  A pre-compiled version should always be available from

    http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2.html

  This document describes only the OS/2 specifics. If you're going
  to use GRACE you should read the general documentation files as well!


2) How to build xmgrace
   --------------------
   
  Here I try to give a complete list what you need to build grace.
  The first listed packages have be installed in any case:

  - EMX 0.9 development package
    (http://hobbes.nmsu.edu  and/or http://www.leo.org)

  - XFree86 for OS/2 ("X/2"), including its development package
    (http://borneo.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86os2.html)

  - Lesstif for X/2
    (http://borneo.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86os2.html)

  Additional useful utilities:

  - the "usual" GNU utilities (text, shell, file).
  - un*x shell (sh)

  To actually build grace I use additional libraries which may or
  may not be public available in binary form (grace _can_ be built
  without these packages!). If you can't find them on my webpage,
  I'll provide them as binaries upon request.

    - libhelp and it's little application xmhelp
      (used to display the online help written in HTML)
      Their sources can be found at:
         ftp://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/libhelp/
    - libgd: processing GIF files
         http://www.boutell.com
    - pdflib: creating PDF files
         http://www.ifconnection.de/~tm/
    - fftw library: fourier transformations
         http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~fftw/

  By now the supplied configure (shell-) script may not work under OS/2
  (even using the existing Autoconf port). 
  As a small replacement I offer a small REXX-script 'configos2.cmd' which will

    - copy a standard OS/2 configuration files (config.h and Make.conf)
      from .\arch\os2 to the toplevel source directory
    - build dlfcn.a in \arch\os2 (support for user-supplied mathemtical
      functions in dynamic load libraries)

  configos2.cmd is located in .\arch\os2 and has to be copied
  to the toplevel source directory before executing it.
  Please check .\arch\os2\config.h.os2 and .\arch\os2\Make.conf.os2
  whether they suit your system and modify them if necessary.

  Finally 'x11make.exe' will be called. Note that calling the 'make'
  script from X/2 won't work cause the generic Makefile is using
  shell commands which is disabled by make.cmd.


3) How to install
   ---------------

  At this moment the OS/2 Makefiles don't offer an installation target.
  You have to do it manually ...

  The binary distribution archive can just be unpacked and will
  extract in $(X11ROOT)\. I supply a small REXX-script 'xmgrace1.cmd'
  which will set the necessary environment variable(s) so that xmgrace
  can run within this setup.
  
  In future I plan to include some instructions how to access your installed
  printers without manual processing the Postscript files. But this is
  not only a problem of GRACE but of every non-PM application on OS/2. By now 
  I'm using lpr and lpd to access my local Postscript printer (via a
  loopback interface).
  Check out the printing tools on LEO/Hobbes for useful utiities!
  Or you may 'just' print to a file and do the further processing
  (e.g. running Ghostview/gvpm) of it manually.
