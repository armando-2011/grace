1) Introduction
   ------------

  This is (xm)Grace compiled for OS/2. Since it's an X11 application
  (well, mostly) it requires XFree86 to be installed.
  Like every piece of software this port of Grace may have a few bugs. 
  Some of them are just related to the general problems which un*x based 
  applications have on non-un*x filesystems. So read the documentation and 
  FAQs for XFree86 carefully to get some hints how to avoid running into these 
  bugs&limitations, e.g. it might be a good idea to install TVFS, 
  the Toronto Virtual File System.

  A pre-compiled version should always be available from

    http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/os2stuff.html

  This document describes only the OS/2 specifics. If you're going
  to use Grace you should read the general documentation files as well!



2) How to build Grace
   --------------------
   
  Here I try to give a complete list what you need to build Grace.
  The first listed packages have be installed even if you're only going to
  use the prebuilt binaries. For your convenience I also point to
  locations where you can retrieve the packages.

  - EMX 0.9d (use Fixpack 4)
    Either development (lots of files) or runtime package (emxrt.zip)
      http://hobbes.nmsu.edu, http://www.leo.org

  - XFree86 for OS/2, including its development package(s)
      http://borneo.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86os2.html

  - LessTif for XFree/2 (version 0.92.26 or above)
      http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/lesstif.html

  - libXbae (for LessTif; see above for version information)
      http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/lesstif.html

  - t1lib for XFree/2
      http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/tools.html

  - pdflib for XFree/2 (versions 3.0.x)
      http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/tools.html


  Additional useful utilities:

  - the "usual" GNU utilities (text, shell, file).
  - un*x shell (sh)

  To build Grace I use additional libraries which are not integral parts
  of Grace, in fact it can be built without using them.
  If you can't find them on my webpage, I'll provide them upon request.
  See the generic FAQ where to find the sources for these.

    - libhelp, xmhelp:  Display the online help written in HTML)
    - libpng:           Create PNG files
    - pdflib:           Create PDF files
    - fftw library:     Fast Fourier transformations

  By now the supplied configure script may not work under OS/2
  (even using the existing Autoconf 2.13 port). As a small replacement I offer
  a small REXX-script 'configos2.cmd' which should

    - copy standard OS/2 configuration files (config.h and Make.conf)
      from .\arch\os2 to the toplevel source directory
    - build dlfcn.a in \arch\os2 (support for user-supplied mathematical
      functions in dynamic load libraries = DLLs)
    - build the complete package

  configos2.cmd is located in arch/os2 and has to be copied
  to the toplevel source directory before executing it.
  Please check arch/os2/config.h.os2 and arch/os2/Make.conf.os2
  and modify them if necessary. Especially make changes to
  make use of pre-installed libraries like T1lib and fftw.
  Finally this script wil call 'x11make.exe'.
  Note that calling the 'make' script from XFree/2 won't work,
  because the generic Makefile is using shell commands which are 
  disabled by "make.cmd".



3) How to install
   ---------------

  So far the OS/2 Makefiles don't offer an installation target.
  You have to do it manually ...

  The binary distribution archive can just be unpacked and will
  fit in the tree below $(X11ROOT). I supply a small REXX-script 
  'xmgrace1.cmd' which sets up the necessary environment variable(s)
  so that xmgrace runs fine within this setup.
  Check out the webpage or section 2) How to build Grace for
  other packages which are required to run Grace!
  
  A remaining problem is how to access installed printers
  without manual processing the Postscript files. But this is not only
  tied to Grace but an issue for every non-PM application on OS/2.
  I'm using the network printing tools 'lpr' and 'lpd' (part of OS/2 Warp 4)
  to access my local Postscript printer.
  Check out the printing utilitiess on LEO/Hobbes or  just print to a file
  and do the further processing (e.g. running Ghostscript) manually.
  The document on
    http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/printing.html
  is however still work in progress.
