1) Introduction
   ------------

  Note that this (incomplete) port of GRACE for XFree86 OS/2 is still work
  in progress  and may therefore still have some bugs. Some of them are just
  related to the general problems un*x based applications have on non-un*x
  filesystems. So read the documentation and FAQs of XFree86
  carefully to get some hints how to avoid running into these bugs or
  better 'limitations' (a good idea is installing TVFS, the Toronto
  Virtual File System).

  A pre-compiled version should always be available from

    http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2.html


  This document describes only the OS/2 specifics. If you're going
  to use GRACE you should read the general documentation files as well !


2) How to re-build                 
   ---------------
   
  Here I try to give a (complete?) list what you'll need to build grace:

  The first listed packages have be installed anyway:

  - EMX 09c (full development package to re-compile)
    available from  
      http://hobbes.nmsu.edu  and/or
      http://www.leo.org/cgi-bin/leo-dls/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/00-index.html

  - XFree86 for OS/2 ("XFree/2")
    available from  
      http://borneo.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86os2.html
    including it's development package

  - Lesstif >= 0.82 for XFree/2
    available from  
      http://borneo.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86os2.html

  Additional useful utilities:

  - The "usual" GNU utilities (text, shell, file).
  - An un*x shell is necessary.

  To actually build grace I used additional libraries which may or
  may not be public available in binary form (grace _can_ be build
  without these packages). Well, at least they could be found in
  binary distributions from the URL given above.

    - libhelp and it's little application xmhelp
      (used to display the online help written in HTML)
      Their sources can be found at:
         ftp://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/libhelp/
     - libgd
       (process GIF files)
          http://www.boutell.com
     - pdflib
       (handles PDF files)
          http://www.ifconnection.de/~tm/
     - fftw library
       (-> README.fftw)
          http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~fftw/

  So far the supplied configure (shell-) script doesn't work under OS/2
  and even the Autoconf port still fails. As a small replacement I offer
  a small REXX-script 'configos2.cmd' which will just

  - copy the standard OS/2 configuration files (config.h and Make.conf)
    from .\arch\os2 to the toplevel source directory
  - build dlfcn.a in \arch\os2 (support for user-supplied mathemtical
    functions in dynamic load libraries)

  configos2.cmd is located in .\arch\os2 and has to be copied
  to the toplevel source directory before executing it.
  Future versions of configos2 might adapt these files slightly to
  reflect the small possible differences of the specific system.
  For now please check .\arch\os2\config.h.os2 and .\arch\os2\Make.conf.os2
  whether they suit your system.

  Finally 'x11make.exe' will be called. Note that calling the 'make'
  script from XFree/2 won't work cause the generic Makefile is using
  shell commands.


3) How to install
   ---------------

  At this moment the OS/2 Makefiles don't (fully) support installing in
  the standard directory structure under \XFree86 or $(X11ROOT)\XFree86.

  The binary distribution's archive can just be unpacked in
  $(X11ROOT)\ and is automatically installed! I also supply a small
  REXX-script 'xmgrace1.cmd' which will set the necessary environment
  variable(s).
  
  I plan to include some instructions how to access your installed
  printers without manual processing the Postscript files. But this is
  of course not only a problem of GRACE but of every non-PM application
  on OS/2. By now I'm using lpr and lpd to access my Postscript printer.
