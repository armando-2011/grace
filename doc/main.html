   <h2> <a NAME="mainpanel">Main panel</a> </h2>
<p>
There are 5 main areas in the display, the menu bar at the top, the 
locator bar just below, the toolbar along the left-hand side of the display,
the status bar at the bottom, and the drawing area where graphics are drawn.
The following items describe the locator bar, the toolbar, and the status 
bar.
<HR>
<ul>
<li><a NAME="toolbar"><b>Tool bar</b></a>
<p>The toolbar runs along the left-hand side of the display, and provides 
functions to manipulate the axes scaling of active graphs, by scrolling 
and mouse powered zooms.
<p>
          <ul>
	  <li><a NAME="draw">Draw</a>
<p>
Click on <b>Draw</b> to freshen up the drawing area with the 
current set of graphs, parameters and active sets. Most operations 
perform an automatic redraw, this may be undesirable in the cases where
the sets are large or there are several active graphs. By playing with
the options in <b>Graph/Draw options</b> and using the <b>Draw</b> button, 
much of the tedium associated with slow redraw rates can be alleviated.
If you feel something should have happened after performing an operation,
press this button to force a draw operation to freshen up the display. If 
the X display being used does not do backing store, then <b>Draw</b> will 
give a clean picture if the graphics get damaged when overlaid by popups 
or other applications.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="zoom">Zoom</a>
<p>
    Zoom
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="as">Autoscale</a>
<p>
Click on Autoscale to generate a default scaling for both the X and Y
axes in the current graph.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="expand">Expand</a>
<p>
Click on Expand to incrementally zoom in on the data.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="shrink">Shrink</a>
<p>
Click on Shrink to incrementally zoom out from the data.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="left">Page left</a>
<p>
Click on Left to incrementally shift the axes to the left.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="right">Page right</a>
<p>
Click on Right to incrementally shift the axes to the right.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="down">Page down</a>
<p>
Click on Down to incrementally shift the axes down.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="up">Page up</a>
<p>
Click on Up to incrementally shift the axes up.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="autoticks">Auto ticks</a>
<p>
Using any of the buttons that affect the scale of the axes, it is likely that
unpleasing tickmarks will result. By clicking on AutoT, the tick spacing will
be set using the current autoscaling parameters (set in Graph/Autoscale).
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="autoon">Auto scale on a picked set</a>
<p>
Click on AutoO then click near a point in the set of interest to autoscale
the current graph with respect to the selected set's bounding box.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="zoomx">Zoom X</a>
<p>
Select a Zoom line used to scale the X axis of the current graph.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="zoomy">Zoom Y</a>
<p>
Select a Zoom line used to scale the Y axis of the current graph.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="autox">Auto X</a>
<p>
Autoscale the X axis only.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="autoy">Auto Y</a>
<p>
Autoscale the Y axis only.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="pz">Push 'n zoom</a>
<p>
Save the current graph's axes scales and tickmark settings, and prepare
for a zoom. This function can be used to zoom in on an area of interest,
then restore the previous graph scale.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="pu">Push</a>
<p>
Save the current graph's axes scales and tickmark settings for later
retrieval. Use Pop to restore.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="po">Pop</a>
<p>
Restore the current graph's axes scale saved from the most recent use
of Push.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="cy">Cycle</a>
<p>
Cycle allows the contents of the current graph's world stack to be displayed
in stack order. The contents of the stack are unaffected.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="sd">Stack depth</a>
<p>
Report on the current depth of the stack. Each graph has its own stack.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="cw">Current world</a>
<p>
When cycling through the current graph's world stack, display the position
in the stack.
<p>
	  <li><a NAME="exit">Exit</a>
<p>
Exit xmgr.
          </ul>
<p>
<HR>
	<li><a NAME="locbar">Locator bar</a>
The Locator bar, found directly under the main menu bar, displays the current graph
and the position of the pointer. To set properties of the locator display
text, see <b>View/Locator props</b>.
<HR>
	<li><a NAME="statbar">Status bar</a>
The Status bar, at the bottom of the display, reports on items of interest
and provides a line of help when the mouse is used in any operation.
