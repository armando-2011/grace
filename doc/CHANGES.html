<H1>Grace list of changes</H1>

<PRE>

<H2>5.0.0 (since Xmgr-4.1.2):</H2>

<H3>New functionality</H3>
 *  [ES] T1 fonts are used for all devices using the T1lib library of Rainer
         Menzner. There should be no discrepancies anymore between characters
         displayed and printed (rep. #16)
 *  [ES] routines of drawing layer rewritten from the scratch; Grace is now
         almost WYSIWYG, except patterns (rep. #184)
 *  [EV] generic I/O filtering implemented (including rep. #240); see docs
         for details
 !  [ES] reciprocal axis scale implemented (rep. #33)
 *  [EV] system-wide gracerc ($GRACE_HOME/gracerc) will be read at startup
         time, if exists
 !  [ES] overlined strings are possible (\o \O) (rep. #176). Doesn't work with
         device fonts yet
 !  [MM] extensions to regions including horizontal-inside, horizontal-outside,
         vertical-inside and vertical-outside
 !  [MM] Grace will use the FFTW library for Fourier transform if present on
         the system; see README.FFTW
 *  [MM] negative indices in "Drop points" allowed (counting from the end of
         a set)
 *  [EV] added a new feature to be extracted - the integral of each set
 !  [ES] "unit" and "const" added to the possible proctype's for modules.
         DEG (below) is an example what "unit" can be used for
 !  [ES] DEG and RAD are now meaningful. E.g., expressions like sin(90 deg)
         and sin(pi/2 rad) both are legitimate (and equivalent!) ("rad" can be 
         omitted - it's there just for the sake of completeness)
 *  [ES] metafile driver (not in final state)
 *  [ES] PDF driver using the PDFlib of Thomas Merz; see README.PDF
 *  [ES] GIF/GD driver using the GD library of Thomas Boutell (rep. #14); see
         README.GIF
 *  [ES] logarithmic scales can have any base (rep. #370)
 *  [ES] patterns and colors can be used simultaneously (rep. #291)
 *  [ES] power tick label format changed to work in scientific format 
         (rep. #361)
 *  [ES] \B in composite strings will reset the font to the string's initial
         font (rep. #388)
 *  [ES] PS/EPS driver rewritten from the scratch
 *  [ES] X11 driver heavily rewritten

         printed out in readable form
 *  [EV] scrolled windows for explicitly requested expressions
 *  [EV] canvas hotkeys added
 !  [ES] re-designed print setup GUI popup (problems in rep. #372, #412 
         should be fixed)
 *  [ES] changing page size is possible for any device separately; the units
         can be "pix"els, "cm" or "in" (rep. #108, #211, #216, #405)

<H3>Project files</H3>
 *  [EV] background color saved
 *  [MM] all regions, whether active or not, are saved to the file, so
         temporarily inactive regions don't get lost
 *  [ES] page size is saved (rep. #312)
 
<H3>Parser</H3>
 *  [ES] cleaned grammar parser; instead of 350 shift/reduce and 231

<H3>Defaults</H3>
 !  [ES] default page layout changed from free to fixed
 *  [ES] \+ increases font size sqrt(sqrt(2)) times; \- respectively,
         decreases. Sub/superscripts are 1/sqrt(2) of the preceeding font size
