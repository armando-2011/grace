 <TITLE>Xmgr and the Named Pipe Feature</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1>What is the Named Pipe Option?</H1>

<P>
The named pipe option can be used to display data in real-time. That is, with
the named pipe option you can use xmgr to display data immediately as you
generate them by your number-crunching program. In contrast with the simple
pipe option, xmgr's graphic user interface remains responsive to your actions
while displaying the data.
</P>

<H1>What is a Named Pipe Anyway?</H1>

<P>
A simple pipe is used, for example, by the command
</P>

<PRE>
    grep searchfor file | more
</PRE>

<P>
The "<CODE>|</CODE>" symbol is the pipe, i.e. the output of <CODE>grep</CODE>
is mounted to one end of the pipe, and the input of <CODE>more</CODE> is
mounted to the other end of the pipe. Everything that <CODE>grep</CODE> writes
to its standard output goes through the pipe, and <CODE>more</CODE> sees this
on its standard input. Another name for a pipe is FIFO (First In First Out).
That means that things arrive at the end of the pipe in the same order as you
put them in (in contrast with a stack, where you'll see first what you put in
last).
</P>

<P>
A named pipe is essentially the same, except that (you guessed it) the pipe
gets a file name. Before we can use a named pipe, we have to create it. That
can be done using
</P>

<PRE>
    mkfifo /tmp/mynamedpipe
</PRE>

<P>
from the shell prompt, or using the C function
</P>

<PRE>
    #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
    .
    .
    mkfifo ("/tmp/mypipename", 0600);
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>0600</CODE> sets the access permissions for the named pipe.
</P>

<P>
After having created the named pipe, one program can open that file name for
writing (as you would open any ordinary file), and another program can open the
file for reading. Here is a simple example:
</P>

<PRE>
    mkfifo /tmp/testpipe
    echo "This is a test" &gt; /tmp/testpipe &amp;
    cat /tmp/testpipe
    rm /tmp/testpipe
</PRE>

<P>
You can use the the C functions "<CODE>open</CODE>" or "<CODE>fopen</CODE>" to
mount a process to the pipe.
</P>

<P>
The named pipe behaves very much like an ordinary file, except that
</P>

<OL>
<LI>only one process can open the named pipe for writing, and only one process
can open the pipe for reading (at the same time),</LI>
<LI>nothing is written to the disk but rather into some memory buffer,</LI>
<LI>if the listening end closes the pipe while the talking end has the pipe
still open for writing, the talking end gets a signal <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE>. If
we did not install a signal handler for <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE>, the talking end
exits.</LI>
</OL>

<H1>How Can I Use the Named Pipe Option with Xmgr?</H1>

<H2>How Does Xmgr Handle a Named Pipe?</H2>

<P>
If xmgr is used with the named pipe option, it starts a timer that ticks in
intervals of 1000 milliseconds. You can change that interval using the "-timer"
command line option. When the first tick occurs, xmgr opens and reads the named
pipe and executes the corresponding commands. At the second tick, xmgr closes
the pipe. At the third tick, xmgr reopens the pipe, and so forth. In other
words, every two seconds we give xmgr a one-second break to respond to commands
from the graphic user interface if the commands at the named pipe arrive faster
than xmgr can execute them.
</P>

<H2>How Do I Implement My "Talking End"?</H2>

<P>
There are at least two different ways how to implement the talking end (your
number-cruncher).
</P>

<H3>First way</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Create a fifo using the "mkfifo" command from the shell prompt.</LI>
<LI>Start your number-cruncher and let it open the named fifo's filename for
writing. You should send <A HREF="commands.html">xmgr commands</A> to the
pipe.</LI>
<LI>Start xmgr with the named pipe option from the shell prompt ("<CODE>xmgr
-npipe /tmp/mypipe</CODE>")</LI>
</OL>

<H3>Second way</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Start your program. Your program creates the named pipe using the "mkfifo"
library call.</LI>
<LI>Your program forks (see "<CODE>man fork</CODE>").</LI>
<LI>The child process executes xmgr with the named pipe option.</LI>
<LI>The parent process opens the named pipe for writing, generates data, and
sends <A HREF="commands.html">commands</A> to the pipe.</LI>
</OL>

<P>
As described above, xmgr will close the named pipe every two seconds.
Therefore, your talking end will receive the signal <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> every
two seconds as long as the named pipe is open for writing. The default action
of a program is to exit on <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE>. Hence, you need to tell your
program to ignore <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE>'s:
</P>

<PRE>
    #include &lt;signal.h&gt;
    .
    .
    /* Don't exit on SIGPIPE */
    signal (SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN);
</PRE>

<P>
If you try to write to the pipe while xmgr has closed its listening end, the
thus written commands are lost - xmgr will never see them. Therefore, after
each <CODE>write</CODE> to the pipe you should test whether the write was
successful. If it was not, the write operation needs to be repeated later.
</P>

<P>
One way to handle this problem is to append new commands to a global buffer
instead of sending them directly. Each time we append some new commands to that
buffer, we subsequently try to write the buffer to the pipe. If the write
operation succeeds, we clear the buffer. If it fails, we try to resend the
contents of the buffer next time we append a new command.
</P>

<P>
There is still a problem we need to take care of: it might happen that we
always try to write to the pipe when xmgr is not listening. For example, if we
send new data to xmgr approximately every two seconds, there is a good chance
that we find xmgr not listening for quite a long time. This can lead to an
overflow of the buffer. Therefore, each time we append some new commands to the
buffer we should check whether the buffer filling exceeds some threshold. If it
does, we should wait for xmgr's next sensitive time window and send the entire
buffer before continuing our calculations.
</P>

Isn't there a simpler solution?

<P>
Yes, there is. You can use the 
<A HREF="acegr_np.html"><CODE>acegr_np</CODE></A> library that comes with xmgr
and implements the solutions suggested in the above.
