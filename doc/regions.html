	<h3> <a NAME="defregion"><b>Define region</b></a> </h3>
<p>
Define a region of interest on a graph or graphs.
<p>
	Select the region, there are 5.
<p>
	Select the type of region:
<p>
<dl>
	<dt> Inside polygon
<dd> Points inside a closed, non-intersecting polygon are considered inside 
the region.
<p>
	<dt> Outside polygon
<dd> Points outside a closed, non-intersecting polygon are considered 
inside the region.
<p>
	<dt> Above, below, to the left, and to the right
<dd> Regions defining a half-plane, points inside the half-plane are 
considered in the region.
</dl>
<p>
Select the type of linkage, either a particular graph or all graphs, the
default is the  current graph.
<p>
Press <b>Accept</b> to make the pointer ready for the region definition.

In the line case, define the line by clicking on the beginning point and

	<h3> <a NAME="evalregion"><b>Evaluate in region</b></a> </h3>
<p>
Evaluate an expression applied to points within a region.
<p>
	Select the region to use.
<p>
	Enter the expression, regions are referred to by Rn.x or Rn.y where `n'
	is the number of the region to use. Functions available are the same as
	those in `Evaluate expressions' described above.
<p>
Examples:
<p>
R0.X = R0.X - 1
<p>

	<h3> <a NAME="clearregion"><b>Clear region</b></a> </h3>
<p>
Remove a defined region.
<p>
	Select the region to remove and press `Apply'.

	<h3> <a NAME="extractregion"><b>Extract points</b></a> </h3>
<p>
Extract points from a region to a set
<p>
	Select the region to use. 
<p>
	Select the set to receive the points. 
<p>
	Select the graph to put the set. 
<p>
	Click on <b>Accept</b> to combine all points within the 
specified region to the specified set and graph.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="deleteregion"><b>Delete points</b></a> </h3>
<p>
Delete points in a region.
<p>
	Select the region to use.
