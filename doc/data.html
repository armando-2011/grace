<h2><a NAME="data">Data operations</a></h2>

Access the command line interpreter, 
describe the status of data sets, graphs and regions, display 
results of computations and other operations, perform transformations, set
operations, point operations, region operations, block data management.

	<h3> <a NAME="status">Status</a> </h3>
<p>
The <b>Status</b> popup displays useful information about the state of 
sets, regions, and graphs. In addition to this, several useful operations
are provided to manipulate sets and graphs. 
<p>
At the bottom of the popup are the controls for displaying what
appears in the top portion of the popup. Directly this above is a panel that
provides operations on the objects displayed in the scrolled region.
<p>
Staring with the bottom panel, from left to right, the selections are:
<p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Close</b>
<dt> Close the <b>Status</b> popup.
<dd><b>Update</b>
<dt> Freshen up the status display.
<dd><b>Write</b>
<dt> Write the contents of the status display to the <b>Results</b> popup, from
there, the information provided by <B>Status</b> can be written to disk.
<dd><b>Page+</b>
<dt> Page forward through the status display. There is a limit as to how
many sets can be displayed in the <b>Status</b> popup at one time. By
default, the maximum is 30. When the number of sets is less than 30, this
button is not needed, use the scroll bars to view the status of the sets that
are not shown in the display.
<dd><b>Page-</b>
<dt> Page backward through the status display. There is a limit as to how
many sets can be displayed in the <b>Status</b> display region at one time. By
default, the maximum is 30. When the number of sets is less than 30, this
button is not needed, use the scroll bars to view the status of the sets that
are not shown in the display.
<dd><b>Home</b>
<dt> Go to the first page of the status display.
<dd><b>End</b>
<dt> Go to the last page of the status display.
<dd><b>Adjust</b>
<dt> Adjust the width of the status window to completely show the longest
comment.
<dd><b>Display</b>
<dt> An option menu used to select the object types to view, sets, graphs,
or regions. The operations panel directly above will change as the object
type in this item is changed.
</dl>

<HR>
Operations in the <b>Status</b> popup are performed by clicking on the
operation, then clicking on one or more set numbers shown in the display.
There is a status line provided that will give a bit of help on what
actions to take to perform a given operation. Generally, the cursor will
change to reflect the nature of the operation.
<p>
When the selection for <b>Display</b> is <b>Sets</b>, the operations provided
are:
<dl>
<dd><b>Kill</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>Kill</b> activates the pointer such that clicking on a 
set number shown in the display of the <b>Status</b> popup kills the set.
After a set is <b>Kill</b>'ed, the point remains hot, the <b>Kill</b>
operation can be performed again, until the <b>Cancel</b> button
is pressed.
<dd><b>Soft kill</b>
<dt> This is the same as <b>Kill</b> except that all parameters are
preserved.
<dd><b>Deact</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>Deact</b> followed by clicking on a set number in the
scrolled window will deactivate the set (deactivation merely hides the
set, the data are not released). The function can be useful when there are
lots of sets being drawn, and the interest is in a subset of the sets
being display in the drawing area.
<dd><b>React</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>React</b> followed by clicking on a set number in the
scrolled window will reactivate the set if it has previously be deactivated.
<dd><b>Copy</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>Copy</b> followed by clicking on a set number in the
scrolled window will select the set to copy from. Click again on another set
number to perform the copy. One trick that can be performed here is that 
this operation can be used to copy sets from one graph to another by 
changing the current graph. The current graph must be changed by either
clicking on the graph to receive the focus on the drawing area, or using
<b>Graph/Graph operations</b>.
<dd><b>Move</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>Move</b> followed by clicking on a set number in the
scrolled window will select the set to move. Click again on another set
number to perform the move. One trick that can be performed here is that 
this operation can be used to move sets from one graph to another by 
changing the current graph. The current graph must be changed by either
clicking on the graph to receive the focus on the drawing area, or using
<b>Graph/Graph operations</b>.
<dd><b>Auto</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>Auto</b> followed by clicking on a set number in the
scrolled window will select autoscale the graph axes such that the set in
its entirety is displayed in the drawing area.
<dd><b>Reverse</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>Reverse</b> followed by clicking on a set number in the
scrolled window will select reverse the order of the points in the set.
<dd><b>Reverse</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>Join</b> followed by clicking on a set number in the
scrolled window will select the set to join to, Click again on another
set number to complete the join.
<dd><b>Pack</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>Pack</b> renumbers sets such that there are no gaps in the
set structure. If the active sets are 0, 3, 5, following the pack operation,
the sets will be numbered 0, 1, 2.
<dd><b>Cancel</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>Cancel</b> cancels any of the operations above that
require more than a single set to function (Copy, Move, Join). Also,
most of the operations stay in effect until <b>Cancel</b> is pressed.
<dd><b>Auto redraw</b>
<dt> Controls whether or not xmgr redraws its canvas after each set
operation in the status window. This takes effect only if the global
auto redraw option is on (in Options-&gt;Draw options).
</dl>

<HR>
<p>
When the selection for <b>Display</b> is <b>Graphs</b>, the operations provided
are:

<dl>
<dd><b>Activate</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>Activate</b> then clicking on a graph number activates the

<dd><b>Copy</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>Copy</b> then clicking on a graph number selects the
graph to copy from. Clicking on another graph selects the graph to copy
to.
<dd><b>Move</b>
<dt> Clicking on <b>Move</b> then clicking on a graph number selects the
graph to move from. Clicking on another graph selects the graph to move 
to.
<dd><b>Swap</b>
<dt> To swap 2 graphs, click on <b>Swap</b> then click on a graph number 
to select the first graph, then click again on the second graph to perform
the swap.
<dd><b>Hide</b>
<dt> To hide a graph, click on <b>Hide</b> then click on a graph number.
<dd><b>Show</b>
<dt> To undo the effect of <b>Hide</b>, click on <b>Show</b> then click on a 
graph number.
<dd><b>Focus</b>

<dt> To kill a graph, click on <b>Kill</b> then click on a graph number.
<dd><b>Cancel</b>

<hr>

	<h3> <a NAME="blockdata">Block data</a> </h3>
<p>
Create sets from block data. Select the type of set and the columns to use for
each vector  of the new set. Press <b>Accept</b> to create the set. Note that
reading block data does not  affect the scaling of the graph so when a set is
created using this popup, the set may not  appear within the graph's scaling
limits - use AS (Autoscale) to set the scale of the  graph if needed (or use
View/Define world).
<hr>

	<h3> <a NAME="hotlink">Hot links</a> </h3>
Hot links allow sets with changing data to be updated without having to
delete sets and reread them. A set is linked to a file or the stdout of a
pipe command and gets refreshed when the <b>Update</b> button is hit
or the hot key defining the 
<a href="usage.html#hotkeys">refresh_hotlink() action</a> is depressed.
In addition, it is possible to specify an xmgr command to be executed
after each update.
See the <a href="commands.html">command interpreter</a> for possible
commands.
<p>
To link a file, select the set you want to be hot, select whether the
Source of data is to be a disk file or a pipe command
and finally enter the disk
file or command on the line provided.
A file browser may be invoked by pressing <b>Files...</b> to aid in
selecting the disk file.
Now hit the <b>Link</b> button.
The newly created link will now appear in the topmost panel.
<p>
It is possible to link multiple columns of data within one file (or pipe).
To do so, repeat the steps above
except select as many sets to link as there are columns of data in
the file.
The links list will append  &quot<tt>:#</tt>&quot to the pipe or file name 
where <tt>#</tt>
indicates which column of data is associated with that set.
It is assumed that for a multiple column file, the first column provides the
x values with multiple y columns (x y1 y2 ... yn).
<p>
The text entered in the <b>Command</b> widget will be executed automatically 
each time an update is requested, after any sets have been read.
Commands are sent to the <a href="commands.html">command interpreter</a>.
<p>
To delete a link, select it from the topmost panel and <b>Unlink</b> it.
