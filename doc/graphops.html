<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="activate">Activate</a> </h3>
<p>
Make a graph eligible for receiving the graph focus and other operations.
Select the graph to activate and press <b>Accept</b>.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="copy">Copy</a> </h3>
<p>
Copy a graph to another graph.
<p>
Select the graph to copy from and the graph to copy to and press 
<b>Accept</b>. 
<p>
Note: Copying a graph will automatically conceal one of the graphs as 
they will both have the same viewport settings. Some adjustments in the 
viewport settings of either or both graphs will be required for each 
graph to be displayed in a non-overlapping manner.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="swap">Swap</a> </h3>
<p>
Exchange two graphs.
<p>
Select the first graph then the second and press <b>Accept</b> to exchange 
the contents of the two graphs. This can be used to adjust the order in 
which graphs are drawn, as graphs are drawn in numerical order starting 
with graph 0.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="kill">Kill</a> </h3>
<p>
Make a graph inactive and free all storage associated with sets.
Select the graph to kill and press <b>Accept</b>.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="focus">Focus</a> </h3>
<p>
Set the graph focus, the focus policy and toggle the display of focus markers.
Select the graph to have the focus, the focus policy, and the toggle for 
the focus markers and press <b>Accept</b>.
<p>
Note: Most operations in xmgr act on the current graph. Not noticing which 
graph has the current focus can be a source of frustration when working with 
xmgr - if you plan to work extensively with a particular graph, it might 
be useful to set the focus policy to <b>Set</b> to fix xmgr's notion of 
the current graph.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="show">Show</a> </h3>
<p>
Toggle the display of a one or more graphs.
<p>
Select which graph or graphs to show, then press <b>Accept</b>. The default 
is to show all active graphs.
<p>
This item can relieve some of the drudgery when working with multiple graphs, 
especially when some of the graphs contain large data sets.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="type">Set graph type</a> </h3>
<p>
Set the current graph type to XY, log-linear, linear-log, log-log, bar or 
stacked bar.  Select the graph type, and press <b>Accept</b>.
<p>
Note: As of this writing, very little is done to ensure that the data are 
acceptable for log plots.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="arrange">Arrange graphs</a> </h3>
<p>
Place several graphs in a non-overlapping manner.
<p>
Select the number of rows and the number of columns, the packing method, 
the vertical and horizontal spacing between graphs in viewport coordinates, 
the start of the first graph in viewport coordinates, and how wide and how 
tall each graph should be. Graphs are laid out in column major order 
starting from the lower left. So, given 3 columns and 2 rows the graphs 
will be laid out as follows:
<pre>

 1   3   5

 0   2   4

</pre>
Given 3 columns and 3 rows:
<pre>

 2   5   8

 1   4   7

 0   3   6

</pre>
<p>
Note that graphs are numbered from 0.
<p>
The packing selection packs the graphs vertically, horizontally or both. Use 
this item when there are several graphs with the same X or Y axis scaling 
so graphs on the outside of the packing arrangement provide the tick and 
axis labeling for all graphs in that row or column. In the 3x3 example 
above,selecting packing `both', graphs 3, 6 will have X-axis tick labels, 
and graphs 1, 2 will have Y-axis tick labels. Graphs 4, 5, 7, 8 
will have neither X or Y axis tick labels, while graph 0 will have both.
<p>
Note that the graph width is computed using the 
number of columns, horizontal gap, X starting location and packing
whenever the number of columns is selected. Likewise, the graph height is 
recomputed using the number of rows, packing, vertical gap and starting Y value
whenever the number of rows is selected. New values for the rows and columns
need not be chosen for the computation to occur.
<p>
If the number of graphs chosen is decreased, the higher number graphs will
still be displayed. They must be <a href="#kill">killed</a> 
or <a href="#show">not shown</a> to be removed.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="overlay">Overlay</a> </h3>
<p>
Overlay one graph onto another. This can be used to plot sets of 
different scale in what will appear to be the same graph.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="invert">Invert/flip axes</a> </h3>
<p>
Reverse the direction of the X or Y axes or exchange the X and Y axes.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="image">Image</a> </h3>
<p>
Read and place an X window dump file on the drawing area. At the present time,
only one image per session is allowed.
