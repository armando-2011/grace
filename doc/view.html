<h2>View</h2> 
<p>
Set the display of the status bar, tool bar, locator bar, and 
properties associated with the display of the pointer position in the Locator 
bar.
<p>
<HR>

   <ul>
   <li><a NAME="status">Status bar</a>
<p>
   Toggle the visibility of the Status bar that appears at the bottom of
the display.
<p>
<HR>
   <li><a NAME="tool">Tool bar</a>
<p>
   Toggle the visibility of the Tool bar at the left of the display.
<p>
<HR>
   <li><a NAME="loc">Locator bar</a>
<p>
   Toggle the visibility of the Locator bar, at the top of the display.
<p>
<HR>
   <li><a NAME="setfixed">Set fixed point</a>
<p>
Select this item, then click on the drawing area to set the position of
the fixed point. To set the position more precisely, use the Locator
props popup described below.
   When the fixed point is set,
and the display format is (DX, DY), (DIST), or (R, Theta) then give the 
location relative to the fixed point.
<p>
<HR>
   <li><a NAME="clearfixed">Clear fixed point</a>
<p>
   Set the fixed point to (0.0, 0.0).
<p>
<HR>
   <li><a NAME="locprops">Locator props</a>
   </ul>
<p>
   Set properties associated with the display of the pointer position
in the locator bar.
<p>
The choice item at the top of the popup, <b>Locator: ON/OFF</b> toggles
the continuous update of the pointer as it moves across the drawing area.
<b>Locator display type</b> is a choice item the sets the display of the
position. There are several options:
   <ul>
   <li><b>[X,Y]</b> The default, display the position in the coordinate system
of the current graph.
   <li><b>[DX, DY]</b> Display the delta in X and Y of the position of the mouse 
relative to the fixed point, or (0, 0) if no fixed point has been selected. 
The position is given relative to the scaling of the current graph. 
DX = (CX - FX) and DY = (CY - FY).
   <li><b>[Distance]</b> Display the position of the mouse as the distance from the
fixed point, or (0, 0) if no fixed point has been selected. The distance is 
computed as SQRT((FX - CX)^2 + (FY - CY)^2) where (FX, FY) are the coordinates
of the fixed point, and (CX, CY) is the position of the pointer.
   <li><b>[R, Theta]</b> Display the position of the mouse in polar coordinates 
(R, Theta) relative to the fixed point, or (0, 0) if no fixed point has 
been selected. R = SQRT((FX - CX)^2 + (FY - CY)^2)  and Theta = ATAN2(DY, DX).
   <li><b>[VX, VY]</b> Display the position of the mouse in viewport coordinates.
This position is independent of the scaling of the current graph.
   <li><b>[SX, SY]</b> Display the position of the mouse in screen coordinates.
This position is independent of the scaling of the current graph.
   </ul>

<p>
The next two categories in the popup set the format and fixed point
positions for each coordinate direction and, as they are identical, only setting
the format and position of X is described here. The description for
Y is identical save that ordinate is replaced by abscissa.
<p> 
<b>Format X:</b> is a choice item selecting the format of the display of
the X position of the pointer. There are several selections here:
<ul>
	<li> Decimal
	<li> Exponential
	<li> Power (displayed as Decimal)
	<li> General
	<li> DD-MM-YY
	<li> MM-DD-YY
	<li> MM-YY
	<li> MM-DD
	<li> Month-DD
	<li> DD-Month
	<li> Month (abbrev..)
	<li> Month
	<li> Day of week (abbrev.)
	<li> Day of week
	<li> Day of year
	<li> HH:MM:SS.s
	<li> MM-DD HH:MM:SS.s
	<li> MM-DD-YY HH:MM:SS.s
	<li> Degrees (lon)
	<li> DD MM' (lon)
	<li> DD MM' SS.s (lon)
	<li> MM' SS.s (lon)
	<li> Degrees (lat)
	<li> DD MM' (lat)
	<li> DD MM' SS.s (lat)
	<li> MM' SS.s (lat)
</ul>
<p>
The Date format requires that the axis be scaled with respect to
the long form of the Julian date. The Degrees format is for latitude and 
longitude. Below the equator latitudes are negative. Longitude is assumed 
positive east of Greenwich and negative to the west.
<p>
<b>Precision X:</b> sets the number of places to display to the right of the 
decimal point.
<p>
<b>Fixed point X:</b> defines the position of the ordinate of the Locator 
fixed point.
<p>
If everything looks OK, click on <b>Accept</b> to register the selections,
<b>Reset</b> to restore the startup values, and <b>Close</b> to close the 
popup.
