	<h3> <a NAME="pickops">Pick ops</a> </h3>
<p>
Pick ops use the point in a set nearest to the location of the pointer 
when clicked to select the set for the chosen operation. The nearest
point is determined by the Euclidean distance which can be very different
from the point that is visually closer. As long as there are sets with points,
the operation will always be performed, which means that a bit of care should
be exercised using these operations.
<p>
        	<ul>
        	<li> <a NAME="pkill">Kill nearest set</a> 
<p>
Kill the set nearest the pointer.
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="pcopy">Copy nearest set</a> 
<p>
Select a set to copy with one click, and the destination, which may be
in another graph, with another click.
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="pmove">Move nearest set</a> 
<p>
Select a set to move with one click, and the destination, which may be
in another graph, with another click.
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="preverse">Reverse nearest set</a> 
<p>
Select a set to reverse by clicking near a point in a set. The result
is that the order of the points is reversed (point N becomes point 1, and point
1 becomes point number N, etc.).
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="pdeact">De-activate nearest set</a> 
<p>
Select a set to deactivate by clicking near a point in a set. The result
is that the set will act as if undefined for most operations, and will not
be drawn even if the line or symbol selections would cause it to be
drawn. The data are not destroyed, and the set can be reactivated using the
functions in File/Status or Data/Set ops.
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="pjoin">Join nearest sets</a> 
<p>
Click near a point in one set to use for the join, then click again
near a point in another set to select the second set. The second set will
be appended to the end of the first set.
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="pdel">Delete range in nearest set</a> 
<p>
Click near a point in one set to use for the start of the range to delete,
then again near the point at the end of the range to delete. The result
is that all points between the 2 selected points will be removed from the
set, including the 2 points selected.
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="pcancel">Cancel operation</a> 
<p>
Cancel any operation in progress.
        	</ul>
<p>
The remaining items in the Set ops toolbox allow sets to be created, 
destroyed, written to disk, moved, sorted, deactivated, reactivated.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="activate">Activate</a> </h3>
<p>
Make a set active and able to participate in operations.
<p>
To activate a set, select the set number, specify the number of points
in the set and click on "Accept."
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="deactivate">Deactivate</a> </h3>
<p>
Make a set inactive and unable to participate in operations. The data 
associated with a deactivated set are still available and all plot 
parameters associated with the set are unchanged. Use the Re-activate set 
item below to make the set known to xmgr again. This item is include for 
those situations where a set is to be ignored temporarily, but 
needed later in the session.
<p>
	Select the set to Deactivate.
<p>
	Press the button marked <b>Accept</b>.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="reactivate">Re-activate</a> </h3>
<p>
Undo the effect of Deactivate. 
<p>
	Select the set to Reactivate, it is a no-op to Reactivate an unused set.
<p>
	Press the button marked <b>Accept</b>.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="length">Set length</a> </h3>
<p>
Set the length of a set.
<p>
	Select the set.
<p>
	Fill in the item marked Length.
<p>
	Press the button marked <b>Accept</b>.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="settype">Change Set type</a> </h3>
<p>
Set the type of a set.
<p>
	Select the set
<p>
	Select the type to set
<p>
	Press the button marked "Accept"
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="copy">Copy</a> </h3>
<p>
Copy one set to another in a possibly different graph.
<p>
	Select the set to copy from.
<p>
	Select the set to copy to.
<p>
	Select the graph to receive the copy.
<p>
	Press the button marked <b>Accept</b>.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="move">Move</a> </h3>
<p>
Move one set to another in a possibly different graph.
<p>
	Select the set to move from.
<p>
	Select the set to move to.
<p>
	Select the graph to receive the set.
<p>
	Press the button marked <b>Accept</b>
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="swap">Swap</a> </h3>
<p>
Exchange one set with another.
<p>
	Select the sets and the graphs these sets reside.
<p>
	Click on <b>Accept</b>.
<p>
The contents of the sets plus all parameters associated with the display 
of the sets are exchanged.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="drop">Drop points</a> </h3>
<p>
Drop points from a set.
<p>
	Select the set.
<p>
	Fill in the items "Start drop" and "End drop".
<p>
	Press the button marked <b>Accept</b>.
<p>
NOTE: Points in a set are numbered from 1 to N, where N is the number of 
points in the set (as opposed to sets which are numbered from 0).<br>
If negative indices are given to the starting and ending points, the numbers
will be interpreted as distances from the <b>END</b> of the set. Thus, dropping
points -1 to -100 drops the last  100 points from the set, while dropping 1 to
100 drops the first 100.  Also, it rationalizes the order of the indices, so
that dropping points 30 to 1 is equivalent to dropping points 1 to 30.  This is
particularly useful with negative indices, as one is likely to type them in in
the order I given in the example above, which resolves to a set of indices which
are not in increasing order.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="join">Join</a> </h3>
<p>
Merge 2 sets together.
<p>
	Select the set that will be appended.
<p>

<p>
	Press the button marked <b>Accept</b> to append the first set 
to the second.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="split">Split</a> </h3>
<p>
Divide a set into other sets.
<p>
	Select the set to split.
<p>
	Enter the length of the resulting sets (say N).
<p>
	Press the button marked <b>Accept</b> to divide the selected set into 
(length of selected set) / N sets with the remainder to the last set. 
<p>
	The first set will be the set selected to split and will contain the 
first N points.

<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="killall">Kill all</a> </h3>

	<h3> <a NAME="pack">Pack sets</a> </h3>
<p>
Move sets so that the set structure in the current graph has no gaps.
<p>
	During the course of several operations on sets, gaps can form in the 
set structure. This can result cause problems when doing a Save all, as
the actual location, i.e. set number,  of the set is not retained in the 
Save file. For example after several operations that create and delete
sets, the active sets are numbered:

0, 3, 4, 5, 9

Following a Pack, the active sets will be numbered:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

<p>
	Press the button marked <b>Accept</b> to pack all sets in the current graph.
