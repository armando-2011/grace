<p>
When the pointer focus is on the canvas (where the graph is drawn), there 
are some shortcuts to activate several actions. They are:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>  ^A - autoscale plot
	<li>  ^B - draw a box (using the current settings for boxes)
	<li>  ^D - delete an object (string, line, or box)
	<li>  ^N - move an object (string, line, or box)
	<li>  ^P - draw a line (using the current settings for lines)
	<li>  ^V - set the viewport with the mouse
	<li>  ^W - write a string (using the current settings for strings)
	<li>  ^X - exit (abruptly) xmgr.
	<li>  ^Z - enable zoom
</ul>
