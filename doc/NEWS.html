<H1>Grace list of changes (since 5.1.*)</H1>

<PRE>

<H2>5.99.0</H2>

<H3>KNOWN ISSUES</H3>

Grace-5.99.0 is a preview release of the forthcoming Grace-6. What does
"preview" mean?

* First, the new format of project files, xgr, has not yet stabilized. In other
words, <B>anything you save with 5.99.0 most probably will not load in the
further 5.99.* and in the final 6.0 release without manual tweaking of some
extent</B>.

* Another big deficiency of this release is that the old command interpreter
has been removed, with no replacement on the horizon as of yet. In other words,
<B>any script-based usage of Grace is impossible now</B>.

Other, smaller issues:

* Non-linear fit is not there (this is a consequence of the above)
* Region interface isn't finished
* Rotated arcs are not functional
* Stacked line plots with filled interior may have symbols shadowed
* Part of the "Point explorer" tool functionality isn't available yet


<H3>Functionality</H3>
 !  [ES] all elements of a project now form a true tree structure with
         rendering following the order. This solved a lot of requests
         (including reps. #226, #806, #894, #960, #1005, #1177, #1229, #1255)
 !  [ES] each element has a string id which can be set to a meaningful value
         (hence solving rep. #1367, #1384)
 *  [ES] all transformation dialogs: act on all data columns (including #659),
         provide destination selectors (rep. #837), use new set selectors
         everywhere (reps. #885, #1195)
 !  [ES] Fourier transforms fully reworked (including reps. #554, #630,
         #684, #1216, #1391)
 !  [ES] feature extraction reworked (including rep. #1130)
 !  [ES] diff/derivatives reworked (including rep. #436) and combined with 
         seasonal differences
 !  [ES] running properties reworked
 !  [ES] integration reworked
 !  [ES] prune data reworked (including reps. #1140, #1342)
 !  [ES] convolution reworked (including #496, #954)
 !  [ES] correlation redone - now performed via Fourier transform
 !  [ES] sampling reworked
 !  [ES] "Cumulative properties" dialog
 !  [ES] positions of drawing objects can be defined in either
         viewport/frame/world cooridnates (including #1336)
 !  [ES] implemented rotation of drawing objects (rep. #1413)
 !  [ES] frame/pointer for text objects (including rep. #1109)
 !  [ES] implemented macro expansion in cstrings (for now, timestamp and
         filename) (including rep. #20)
 *  [ES] include filename when creating sets from block data (rep. #346)
 !  [ES] changed legend length/vgap/hgap params to be defined in the
         viewport coordinates
 !  [ES] no more world coordinates for the legend placement
 !  [ES] allow legend entries to contain a single symbol instead of two
 !  [ES] set filling in legends
 !  [ES] define legend frame placement via anchor point (in the frame
         coordinates) + justification and offset vector (including rep. #833)
 !  [ES] titles/subtitles are separate objects (thus solving rep. #1075)
 !  [ES] justification for annotated values (rep. #1382)
 !  [SJ] "minimum symbol separation" option for set presentation
 *  [AM/ES] X error handler. If X server crashes in the middle of a Grace
         session, your data will be saved
 *  [AG] netCDF: parse and use calibration attributes add_offset, scale_factor
         and understand 1 byte variables

         ticks
 !  [ES] implemented fontsize and linewidth scales per project
 !  [ES] got rid of world stacks
 *  [ES] hotlinks now work for all set types
 !  [ES] arrows now can be filled with different from the line color/pattern

<H3>Interface</H3>
 !  [ES] all "Plot/* appearance" dialogs replaced with Tools/Explorer for easy
         project navigation and editing (including rep. #635, #1374, #1105)
 !  [EV/ES] instant update (rep. #861)
 !  [ES] removed "Geometric transformation" and "Digital filter" dialogs.
         The funcionality is trivially achieved using the generic "Evaluate
         expression" dialog
 !  [ES] removed "Regression" dialog. The functionality will be added to
         the "Non-linear fit" dialog
 !  [ES] get rid of the hotlink popup. The functionality is moved to the
         dataset spreadsheet editor
 !  [ES] color transformations and font rastering in device setup popup
 !  [ES] high/low/smart font AA
