NOTE:
Some of these operations generate new sets, if you run out of sets use 
Edit/Set operations (described below) to kill unneeded sets. Also, the 
scaling of the world coordinate system may be inappropriate for the results 
of many of these operations. Use the Status popup to determine the 
appropriate scaling factors to use in "Define world" (above), or 
use "Autoscale..." (in View/Autoscale above). Most functions operate on 
active sets only.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="eval">Evaluate expressions</a> </h3>
<p>
Evaluates a formula defined in infix fashion.
<p>
Select the set on which the formula will operate, (set must be active, use 
File/Status to find the current state of sets). If you desire the result be 
loaded to a new set rather than overwriting the set used for computations, 
use the panel cycle denoted `Result to' to inform xmgr you'd like the 
result placed in a new set (if there is one). A new set is created only 
if a single set is selected from step 1. If `All sets' are selected 
then the results will overwrite all active sets.
<p>
Enter the formula, the syntax is:
<p>
(x,y,a,b,c,d)=&ltexpression&gt
<p>
where (x,y,a,b,c,d) are defined as the x and y of the currently selected 
set and a,b,c,d are scratch arrays that can be used to perform operations 
between sets. Case is ignored, so X=COS(X) is correct.

Note: See pars.yacc for the yacc grammar.
<p>
Other sets than the current set can be selected using S<i>n</i>.X or
S<i>n</i>.Y where <i>n</i> is the number of the set. Sets from graphs
other than the current graph can be selected using Gm.Sn.X etc.
<p>
The same applies to the set features DX, DY, INDEX, LENGTH. 
<p>
For a vector v, statistical values v.min, v.max, v.avg, and v.sd can be
referred to. 
<p>
The viewport and world corners of the current graph can be accessed by 
VX1, VX2, VY1, VY1 or WX1, WX2, WY1, WY1, respectively. It is possible to
prepend 'G<i>m</i>.' in order to select a graph other than the current.
<p>
More vectors of the set (whether they exist depends on the set type)
can be referenced using S<i>n</i>.Y1 ... S<i>n</i>.Y4. For a set using
3 vectors such as a set of type XYDY, the DY part would be referenced
by Y1 (the third vector).
<!-- TODO: What is the meaning of x0 and x1? -->
<p>
The C notation for conditionals<br> (expr1)?(expr2):(expr3)<br> can be
used, which evaluates to expr2 if expr1 is true, and to expr3
otherwise.
<p>
Examples:
<p>
      y=-y
<p>
      y=x*cos(2*x*PI/100)+sqr(x)
<p>
      x=(index&gt10)*(x-5)+(index&lt=10)*x 
<p>
If the index of the current point is greater than 10 then x=x-5 else x=x.
Conditionals evaluate to 0 if false, anything else is true.
<p>
	a=y 
<p>
Store y of the current set into scratch array "a". You may now select 
another set and perform the operation y=somefunctionof(a)

<p>
	Select the form of the output, magnitude (spectrum), phase, or the 
coefficients.  The spectrum is computed by sqrt(x*x + y*y) where x, y are 
the coefficients computed by the DFT or FFT. Only N/2 values (representing 
frequencies 0 to PI) are loaded to the resulting set.
<p>
	If the magnitude or phase is selected, then the next item, `X = `, 
determines what values should be loaded to X. The index runs from 0 to n/2, 
the frequency is the cyclical ith Fourier frequency, the period is the 
reciprocal of the frequency with the period of the 0th Fourier frequency 
plotted at T+delta, where T is the total length of the data and delta is the 
sampling interval.
<p>
	Select transform or inverse transform.
<p>
	Select real or complex data.
<p>
If real is selected, then the data to be transformed is assumed to be 
in Y, X is assumed equally spaced and is ignored. If complex is selected 
then the real part is assumed to be in X and the imaginary part in Y.

<p>
A set is loaded (if there is one) with the resulting curve.

Notes:

The fitting techniques used by xmgr are as follows:

For linear fits (y=ax+b) a straightforward least squares procedure is used. For
exponential and power fits, the function to fit is linearized, it is important to
note that the statistics generated refer to the parameters of the linearized function 
and not the original function.

to zero will result in the point being ignored.
<p>
<HR>
	<h3> <a NAME="prune">Prune data</a> </h3>
<P>
Prune the data of a set by removing points. This is useful if the
resolution of your data is higher than the resolution of the graphics
device (screen or hardcopy). You can reduce the size of project files
and increase the speed of redraws by removing redundant points.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Select the set.
<P>
<LI> Select the type of data pruning:
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Interpolation: 
<DD> The interpolation type calculates for each point a linear
interpolation of that point based on its neighbors and removes the
point if real y-value and interpolated y-value differ by less than
Delta-Y. The interpolation type requires that the set is sorted: if
both x and y are functions of another variable t, i.e. x(t) and y(t),
the set has to be sorted by t. It is, of course, possible that x(t)=t.
<P>
<DT> Circle, Ellipse, Rectangle:
<DD> These three types remove all points within a circular, elliptical,
or rectangular surrounding of previous points in the set. No particular
order of points is required. Those types are useful, e.g., for sets that
are not quasi-continuous time series but rather discrete maps (just
an example: depict the current heart period versus the previous heart
period).
</DL>
<P>
<LI> Select the size of the surrounding (Delta-X and/or Delta-Y).
<P>
<LI> Select whether the size of the surrounding is specified as
viewport or world coordinates.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Viewport coordinates:
<DD> Delta-X and Delta-Y are specified as viewport coordinates. This
is most useful if you just want to make a graph and don't care about
absolute errors.
<P>
<DT> World coordinates:
<DD> Sometimes (for example, in bifurcation diagrams) points
(approximately) coincide, and you want to compress the data by
removing the "doubles" without significantly increasing the
granularity of the data. In other words, you don't care about any
specific graphics device but rather about the maximum absolute error
caused by pruning. This is important, for example, if you want to use
the pruned set for further calculations. In that case, it is better to
use world coordinates.
You need to specify the type of Delta-X and Delta-Y (linear or
logarithmic). They default to the axes types of the current graph. If
one of the Deltas is logarithmic, it is considered a factor. For
example, interpolation type pruning with logarithmic Delta-Y type and
Delta-Y = 2 means to remove all points for which interpolated and real
value differ by a factor of less than two.
