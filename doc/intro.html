<H1>Introduction</H1>
<p>
<b>Grace</b> is an XY plotting tool for workstations or X-terminals using X. A
few  of its features are:
<ul>
	<li> User defined scaling, tick marks, labels, symbols, line styles, 
	      colors.
	<li> Batch mode for unattended plotting.
	<li> Read and write parameters used during a session.
	<li> Polynomial regression, splines, running averages, DFT/FFT, 
cross/auto-correlation.
	<li> Hardcopy support for PostScript, PDF, and GIF formats.
</ul>
<p>
While Grace has a convenient point-and-click interface, most parameter 
settings and operations are available through a command line interface 
(found in <a HREF="data.html#commands">Data/Commands</a>).

<DT><b>Sets</b>
<dd>
Sets are collections of points, with optional associated values at these 
points. The associated values can be used to display error bars, high-low 
open-close plots and several other features. Sets are connected to a 
graph, and, by default, there are 30 sets per graph. Each set is 
numbered from 0 to the maximum number of sets less one. The number of 
points in a set is limited by the size of virtual memory and are 
numbered from 1 to N where N is the total number of points in the set. 
Operations to manipulate sets are found in <a href="sets.html">Data/Set 
operations</a>, and features such as line styles, symbol types, and
others can be changed from <a href="plot.html#symbols"> 
<b>Graph/Symbols</b></a>. 

<p>

<DT><b>Graphs</b>
<dd>
Graphs are the collection of data sets, tick marks, titles, etc. drawn to 
display the data. By default, there are 10 graphs with each graph owning 
30 sets (both the number of graphs and the number of sets are adjustable 
via command line parameters). Operations on graphs are found in the 
<a href="graphops.html"> <b>Graphs/Graph operations</b></a> popup.
<p>
There are numerous popups accessible through Graphs pulldown menu that allow 
the manipulation of graph parameters. 
Most graph operations work on what is referred to as the `current graph', 
marked by small filled rectangles at the corners of one graph. The 10 graphs 
available by default in this version of Grace are numbered from 0 to 9.
<p>
<DT><b>Regions</b>
<dd>
Regions are sections of the graph defined by the interior or exterior of 
a polygon, or a half plane defined by a line. A region defined by a 
line can be above, below, to the right, or left of the line. Defining 
regions and operations on points inside regions are found in 
<a href="regions.html"> Data/Region operations</a>.
<p>
<DT><b>Parameters</b>
<dd>
Parameters are the settings of symbols, line styles, colors, fonts, etc. 
used to define graphs and the display of the active sets.
