and

.SH FILES
In many cases, when Grace needs to access a file given with a
relative \f4pathname\f1, it searches for the file along the
following path:
\f4 ./pathname:./.grace/pathname:~/.grace/pathname: $GRACE_HOME/pathname\f1

The following files are of a special importance:

.B templates/Default.xgr
- the default template, loaded whenever a new project is started.

.B fonts/FontDataBase
- the file responsible for font configuration.
