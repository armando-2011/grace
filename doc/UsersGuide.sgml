<sect>Introduction
<p>

<sect1>What is Grace?
  <p>
     Grace is a tool to make two-dimensional plots of scientific data. It runs
     under various (if not all) flavours of UNIX with X11 and Motif. Its
     capabilities are roughly similar to GUI-based programs like Sigmaplot or
     Microcal Origin plus script-based tools like Gnuplot or Genplot.  Its
     strength lies in the fact that it combines the convenience of a graphical
     user interface with the power of a scripting language which enables it to
     do sophisticated calculations or perform automated tasks.

     Grace is derived from Xmgr (a.k.a. ACE/gr), originally written by <url
     name="Paul Turner" url="mailto:pturner@teleport.com">.

     From version number 4.00, the development was taken over by a team of
     volunteers under the coordination of <url name="Evgeny Stambulchik"
     url="mailto:fnevgeny@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il">.

     When its copyright was changed to GPL, the name was changed to Grace,
     which stands for ``GRaphing, Advanced Computation and Exploration of
     data'' or ``Grace Revamps ACE/gr''. The first version of Grace available
     is named 5.0.0, while the last public version of Xmgr has the version
     number 4.1.2.

     Paul still maintains and develops a non-public version of Xmgr for
     internal use.

      <enum>
        <item> Configuration
        <itemize>
          <item> Consult README.configure for basic notes on the GNU configure
                 usage
          <item> Extra libraries. Some features will be available only if
                 additional libraries are installed. See README.FFTW,
                 README.PDF and README.GIF
          <item> Run <tt>./configure --help</tt>
                 to get list of additional switches specific to Grace
          <item> Run <tt>./configure &lt;options&gt;</tt>. Just an example:
                 <verb>
  % ./configure --enable-grace-home=/opt/grace 
  --enable-extra-incpath=/usr/local/include:/opt/include \
  --enable-extra-ldpath=/usr/local/lib:/opt/lib --prefix=/usr
                 </verb>
                 would use <tt>/usr/local/include</tt> and
                 <tt>/opt/include</tt> in addition to the default include path
                 and <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt> and <tt>/opt/lib</tt> in addition
                 to the default ld path. As well, all stuff would be put under
                 the /opt/grace directory and soft links made to
                 <tt>/usr/bin</tt>, <tt>/usr/lib</tt> and <tt>/usr/include</tt>.
                   <p>
                 <bf>Note</bf>: If you change one of the
                 <tt>--enable-extra-incpath</tt> or
                 <tt>--enable-extra-ldpath</tt> options from one run of
                 configure to another, remember to delete the
                 <tt>config.cache</tt> file!!!
                   <p>
                 There is one configure switch which must be paid a special
                 attention to: <tt>--enable-config</tt>. Some pre-defined
                 configurations exist: look in the <tt>conf</tt> direcory for
                 the list. Some OS/hardware combinations have more than one
                 configuration file - you'll have to use the switch to choose
                 an alternative one.

  <sect1>General concepts
    <p>

      <sect2>Project files
	<p>

          A project file contains all information necessary to restore a plot
          created by Grace, as well as some of preferences. Each plot is
          represented on a single page, but may have an unlimited number of
          graphs.

      <sect2>Graphs
	<p>

          A graph consists of (every element is optional): a graph frame, axes,
          a title and a subtitle, a number of sets and additional annotative
          objects (time stamp string, text strings, lines, boxes and ellipses).

      <sect2>Sets
	<p>

	  A set is a way of representing numerical data (datasets). It consists
          of a pointer to a dataset plus a collection of parameters describing
          the visual appearance of the data (like color, line dash pattern etc).

      <sect2>Datasets
	<p>

          A dataset is a collection of points with x and y coordinates, up to
          four optional data values (which, depending on the set type, can be
          displayed as error bars or like) and one optional character string.

      <sect2>Regions
	<p>

          Regions are sections of the graph defined by the interior or exterior
          of a polygon, or a half plane defined by a line. Regions are used to
          restrict data transformations to a geometric area occupied by region.

        </itemize>

    <sect2>X resources
      <p>

        The following Grace-specific X resource settings are supported:

        <itemize>
        <item> XMgrace.invertDraw
               <newline>
               Use GXinvert rather than GXxor for rubberband lines.
               If the rubberbanding for zooms and lines, etc. doesn't
               appear on the canvas, set this resource to yes.
               <newline>

        <item> XMgrace.verifyAction

               <newline>
               Allows an opportunity to accept or cancel any operation
               performed.
               <newline>

        <item> XMgrace.allowDoubleClick

               <newline>
               When Yes, allow double clicks on the canvas to bring up various
               popups depending on  the location of the pointer when the double
               click occurs.
               <newline>

        <item> XMgrace.toolBar
               <newline>
               Enables button toolbar
               <newline>

        <item> XMgrace.statusBar
               <newline>
               Enables status bar
               <newline>

        <item> XMgrace.locatorBar
               <newline>
               Enables locator bar
               <newline>

       </itemize>


        It is also possible to customize menus by assigning key accelerators to
        any item.

        The list below describes the menu X resources. For
        example, in order to make Grace popup the Non-linear curve fitting by
        pressing Control+F, you would add the following two lines

        <tt>
          XMgrace*transformationsMenu.nonLinearFit.acceleratorText: Ctrl+F
          <newline>
          XMgrace*transformationsMenu.nonLinearFit.accelerator: Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;f
        </tt>


        to your <tt>.Xresources</tt> file (the file which is read when an X
        session starts; it could be <tt>.Xdefaults</tt>, <tt>.Xsession</tt> or
        some other file - ask your system administrator when in doubt).

<sect>Xmgr to Grace migration guide
  <p>

    This is a very brief guide describing problems and workarounds for
    reading in project files saved with Xmgr. You should read the docs or
    just play with Grace to test new features and controls.
    
    <enum>
    <item> DOCUMENTATION IS LARGELY NOT UPDATED YET!!!

    <item> Grace must be explicitly told the version number of the software
           used to create a file. You can manually put "@version VERSIONID"
           string in the beginning of the file. The VERSIONID is built as
           MAJOR_REV*10000 + MINOR_REV*100 + PATCHLEVEL; so 40101 corresponds
           to xmgr-4.1.1. Projects saved with Xmgr-4.1.2 do NOT need the above,
           since they already have the version string in them.

    <item> The above relates to the ascii projects only. The old binary
           projects (saved with xmgr-4.0.*) are not automatically converted
           anymore. An input filter must be defined to make the conversion work
           on-the-fly. Add the following line to ~/.gracerc or the system-wide
           $GRACE_HOME/gracerc resource file: DEFINE IFILTER "grconvert %s -"
           MAGIC "00000031" See docs for more info on the I/O filters.
 
    <item> Grace is WYSIWYG. Xmgr was not. Many changes required to achieve the
           WYSIWYG'ness led to the situation when graphs with objects carefully
           aligned under Xmgr may not look so under Grace. Grace tries its best
           to compensate for the differences, but sometimes you may have to
           adjust such graphs manually.

    <item> Smith plots don't work now. They'll be put back soon.

    <item> A lot of symbol types (all except *real* symbols) are removed.
           "Location *" types can be replaced (with much higher comfort) by
           A(nnotating)values. "Impulse *", "Histogram *" and "Stair steps *"
           effects can be achieved using the connecting line parameters (Type,
           Drop lines). "Dot" symbol is removed as well; use the filled circle
           symbol of the zero size with no outline to get the same effect.

    <item> Default page layout switched from free (allowing to resize canvas
           with mouse) to fixed. For the old behaviour, put "PAGE LAYOUT FREE"
           in the Grace resource file or use the "-free" command line switch.

    <item> System variables GR_* renamed to GRACE_*

  <sect1>Typesetting <label id="typesetting">
    <p>
      Grace permits quite complex typesetting on a per string basis.
      Any string displayed (titles, legends, tick marks,...) may contain
      special control codes to display subscripts, change fonts within the
      string etc.

      Example:
      <p>
       F&bsol;sX&bsol;N(&bsol;xe&bsol;f{}) = sin(&bsol;xe&bsol;B)&bsol;c7&bsol;Ce&bsol;S-X&bsol;N&bsol;c7&bsol;Ccos(&bsol;xe&bsol;f{})
      <p>
       prints roughly
       <tscreen><verb>
                       -x
       F (e) = sin(e)&middot;e  &middot;cos(e)
        x
       </verb></tscreen>
      <p>
       using string's initial font and e prints as epsilon from the Symbol font.
      <p>
      NOTE:
      Characters from the upper half of the char table can be entered directly from
      the keyboard, using appropriate <tt>xmodmap(1)</tt> settings.
