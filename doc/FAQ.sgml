    <sect1><heading>What is the difference between Xmgr and Grace?</heading>
      <p>
        Grace is derived from Xmgr (a.k.a. ACE/gr), originally
        written by Paul Turner.

        From version number 4.00, the development was taken over by
        a team of volunteers under the coordination of Evgeny Stambulchik.

        When its copyright was changed to GPL, the name was changed to Grace,
        which stands for ``GRaphing, Advanced Computation and Exploration of
        data'' or ``Grace Revamps ACE/gr''. The first version of Grace
        available is named 5.0.0, while the last public version of Xmgr has
        the version number 4.1.2.

        As of now, most of the codebase has been re-written from scratch.

        Apart from the licensing, the main difference is that Grace is
        WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). This was achieved through a
        major rewrite of all the mid-level drawing routines and the use of
        the device-independent Type 1 font rendering.
        
        For help with changing from Xmgr to Grace see section 
        <tt>Xmgr to Grace migration guide</tt> in the
        User's Guide (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">.

        There are currently a few features of Xmgr which are not yet
        implemented in Grace (of course, alongside with a lot of new stuff
        not found in Xmgr).

        Among the Xmgr features not (yet) implemented in Grace are:

        <itemize>

          <item>X-Y graph flip</item>

          <item>Horizontal and vertical lines as symbols</item>

          <item>Smith plots</item>

        </itemize>
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Why did you change the name?</heading>
      <p>
        When the licensing was changed to GPL, Paul wanted to keep
        the name for his non-public version of Xmgr, so we chose a
        new name.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Is Grace free?</heading>
      <p>
        Yes. Grace is free in terms of the GNU General Public
        License (GPL) (see the file <tt>LICENSE</tt> which comes with
        Grace or the <url url="http://www.gnu.org" name="GNU Home Page">
        for details).
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Who wrote Grace?</heading>
      <p>

        The sources of Grace still contain some amount of code from
        Xmgr by Paul Turner. For a list of those who contributed to Grace
        since then, see the file <tt>NEWS</tt> in the Grace distribution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some integral parts of Grace are borrowed from other
        packages, namely libraries which are also available
        as stand-alone distributions.

  <sect><heading>Getting Help</heading>

    <sect1><heading>Are there any books about Grace?</heading>
      <p>

        As of now, Grace is a purely virtual creature living in the net,
        i.e. there is no printed literature. All relevant docs are currently
        bundled with Grace. See questions <ref id="homepage" name="Home
        Page"> and <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide"> for details. You can
        print your own copy of the FAQ and the User's Guide by
        converting the DVI files to PostScript output.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Is there a User's Guide available for Grace? <label id="manual"></heading>
      <p>

        Yes. It is part of the Grace distribution and usually is
        located in <tt>$GRACE_HOME/doc/</tt>.  There are several
        versions: the SGML source and HTML, LaTeX, DVI and PS
        derived from it. You can read the HTML version from a
        running Grace session by clicking on <tt>"Help/User
        Guide"</tt>. You need a web browser to read the HTML version
        (see also question <ref id="environment" name="Environment
        Variables">). You can always download the newest version
        from the Grace homepage (see question <ref id="homepage"
        name="Home Page">).

        The User's Guide is not quite complete, yet.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Where do I get support for Grace? <label id="support"></heading>
      <p>

        You have the following options:

        <itemize>

          <item>There is a User's Guide (see question <ref id="manual"
              name="User's Guide">) which came with Grace on your
              computer. It is usually located in
              <tt>$GRACE_HOME/doc/</tt> along with other files which
              may contain useful help for your problem. If you
              downloaded the sources, there are even more files in
              the main directory of the source tree.</item>

          <item>Have a look at the Grace home page (question <ref
              id="homepage" name="Home Page">).</item>

          <item>On the Grace forums (see question 
              <ref id="forums" name="Forums"> for details)
              you can easily get in contact with users and
              developers of Grace. However be aware that people
              here are trying to help in their spare time -
              so you can't always expect quick responses.</item>
              
        </itemize>
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Is there a newsgroup devoted to Grace?</heading>
      <p>

        No, there isn't. We feel that a bulletin board (see question
        <ref id="forums" name="Forums">) is more
        appropriate to discuss the topics related to Grace.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Is there a mailing list for Grace?</heading>
      <p>

        There used to be a few, but now they are replaced with
        bulletin-board-style forums (see question
        <ref id="forums" name="Forums">).

        The <url name="mailing list archives"
        url="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/maillists/grace/"> are
        still available for browsing.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Is there a forum for Grace? <label id="forums"></heading>
      <p>

        Yes. Just follow this link: <url name="forums"
        url="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/phpbb/">. It has its
        own FAQ.

  <sect><heading>Providing Help: Finding and Reporting Bugs</heading>

    <sect1><heading>I think I found a bug in Grace! How do I report it?
    <label id="bugreport"></heading>
      <p>
        <descrip>
          <tag>First</tag>
          <p>
            Make sure that what you found really is a bug.
          </p>
          <tag>Second</tag>
          <p>
            Try to make sure that it is a bug in Grace,
            and that the failure is not caused by another piece of
            software.
          </p>
          <tag>Third</tag>
          <p>
            Make sure you are running the latest official
            release of Grace. The development of Grace is
            rather fast, so your bug might already be fixed.
          </p>
          <tag>Fourth</tag>
          <p>
            Try to find out if the bug is already known
            (see question <ref id="w3todo" name="Known Bugs">).
          </p>
          <tag>Fifth</tag>
          <p>
            OK: You <em>have</em> found a new bug. Use
            <bf>w3todo</bf> (question <ref id="w3todo" name="Known
            Bugs">) to report it. Follow the instructions on the
            page and try to be as precise as possible. It won't be of
            much help if you write ``The program crashes.'' Try to
            find a simple reproducible case. Mention the version of
            Grace and where you got the build and the operating system
            you use. You should submit the system info as provided by
            ``uname -a'' (if this utility exists, of course) and the output
            of ``xmgrace -version''. Often the problem is related to
            some specific data set. Please try hard on reducing this
            to the minimum which is sufficient of reproducing the
            bug. If it's only a few lines of data please submit
            it together with the other details.
            Once you submit the bug report, it will be automatically
            relayed to the mailing list. You will usually be notified when
            the bug is fixed or if we need more information, so please
            don't forget to give your correct e-mail address.
          </p>

    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Is there a list of known bugs? <label id="w3todo"></heading>
      <p>
        Yes. You can search and browse the database of known bugs in
        Grace at the bug report facility <url name="w3todo"
        url="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/phpbb/w3todo.php?project_id=1">
        or using the <tt>"Help/Report an issue"</tt> menu from within
        Grace.  The database also keeps track of the status of the
        bug (<tt>Confirmed, Working on, Testing, Fixed, Closed,</tt>
        etc.). This is also the place to submit bug reports and
        wishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some bugs and fixes may not appear in w3todo, but are
        covered on the <ref id="forums" name="forums">.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>The bug report #xxx is marked as "Fixed" in the w3todo, but I
           checked the last version of Grace and the bug is still there!</heading>
      <p>
        The term "fixed" means the bug is fixed in the current 
        <it>development</it> version, and the next <it>public</it> version
        will have the fix in it. Reports with fixes incorporated in an
        existing public version are marked as "Closed".
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>The bug report #xxx I reported is marked as "Ignored" in
           the w3todo and I even got no reply?!</heading>
      <p>
        You must have missed something very obvious. Check out how to
        properly submit a bug report in this document. Most probably your
        report was incomplete or just redundant to an existing entry. It's
        worth checking the log file of the bug report (the "View log" button
        at the bottom of the report viewing page).
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>I have got an idea! How do I report a wish?</heading>
      <p>
        You can submit wishes and suggestions just the way you would
        submit bug reports (see question <ref id="w3todo" name="Known Bugs">).  Suggestions for improvement are
        generally very welcome. It may be possible, however, that
        the developers are busy or that your wish is rejected for
        some good reason, so it may be necessary to persuade (better
        convince) them to get at it.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>I want to help! How can I contribute to Grace?</heading>
      <p>
        Fine! There are always things to do.

        If you are a C programmer, you can almost certainly find
        something useful to do. Just ask on the forums.
        The same applies if you are a technical writer. The documentation
        will certainly need to be updated, corrected or completed.
        Every small contribution is appreciated!

        Make Grace known to your friends and colleagues. The more
        users Grace has, the faster it will be improved.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>How do I submit patches/contributions?</heading>
      <p>
        Prepare diffs against the most recent version. Use
        either unified (-u) or context (-c) diff format.
        Specify exactly against which version the diff is
        supposed to work.
        Finally send them to
        <url url="mailto:fnevgeny_at_weizmann_dot_ac_dot_il">
        
        In case you plan to help this way more than once you should join
        the <ref id="forums" name="forums">.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>I like Grace! Should I donate anything to its authors?</heading>
      <p>
        No need to. But if you feel like making a donation,
        choose any charity organization you like. You wanted to give
        them some money, anyway, right? ;-)

  <sect><heading>Installation</heading>

    <sect1><heading>How do I install Grace? <label id="install"></heading>
      <p>
      You have the choice: either you compile the sources yourself
      or you download precompiled binaries (we strongly suggest you take
      the first route). You can get both from
      the <url url="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/"
      name="Grace Home Page">. Whether binaries for your platforms
      are available (see question <ref id="binaries" name="Binaries">)
      depends on whether one of the developers
      has access to the respective platform and has had time to do
      it.

      It is always a good idea to read the <tt>README</tt>s that accompany
      the downloading packages of Grace.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Can I compile Grace myself?</heading>
      <p>
        Yes! Actually, this is the preferred method of installation.
        After getting the sources (question <ref id="install"
        name="Installation">) and un<tt>gzip</tt>ping and un<tt>tar</tt>ing
        them (use e.g. <tt>gzip -dc grace-5.0.4.tar.gz | tar xvf -</tt>),
        proceed according to the relevant section of the
        <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">, which covers the compilation
        process.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>When I run `configure', it says the XXX package is not found,
           whereas I am certain it was installed on my system!</heading>
      <p>
        There are several possible reasons:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            You have only the run-time part installed (this especially
            concerns GNU/Linux users). However, you should have the
            relevant development package (C header files etc) installed, too.
            E.g., for the JPEG library to be recognized by `configure',
            <it>both</it> <tt>libjpeg62</tt> and <tt>libjpeg62-devel</tt>
            packages must be installed.
          </item>
          <item>
            The library and the header files don't match each other (they are
            from  different versions). This usually happens on large Unix
            systems with a less than capable sysadmin...
          </item>
          <item>
            Either the library or the header files can't be found by the
            compiler. Use the <tt>--with-extra-ldpath</tt> and
            <tt>--with-extra-incpath</tt> configure options to provide the
            extra paths, respectively.
          </item>
        </itemize>
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>When I type './configure' I get: ``configure: error
        M*tif has not been found''</heading>
      <p>

        Check whether M*tif (question <ref id="motif"
        name="M*tif">) is installed on your system. If it is, look
        at the file config.log: there is a line like this:

        <tt>configure:8900: checking for a Motif &gt;= 1002 compatible API</tt>

        What comes directly after it? Could be a hint. Also, see the previous
        question.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>What is Motif (LessTif)? <label id="motif"></heading>
      <p>

        Throughout the Grace docs, saying "M*tif" we actually refer to
        the Motif <it>API</it>, defining a set of functions for building
        graphical user interfaces (GUI) via numerous widgets
        (buttons, labels, etc). Grace makes a heavy use of the M*tif API. 
        
        There are several <it>implementations</it> of the interface. The
        original OSF Motif (see <url url="http://www.opengroup.org">)
        recently changed its license: on open-source platforms you
        may have a chance to use it for free, although it's not in general
        qualified as either a FreeSource or OpenSource product.
 
        There is, however, a free replacement for Motif called LessTif (see
        <url url="http://www.lesstif.org">). LessTif is intended to be a 100%
        source compatible replacement for Motif, but is still under
        development. For the purposes of Grace, try using the latest version
        of LessTif (at least 0.92.6 and above). The LessTif people usually
        receive many bug reports from the Grace developers, so you might hope
        that a few remaining bugs in LessTif will be fixed rather quickly.
      </p>
    </sect1>
             
    <sect1><heading>`configure' stops telling it can't find "ar".</heading>
      <p>
        "ar" is the library archiver (the program used to create static
        libraries like libFoo.a). You should have it in your path. Under
        Solaris, for example, this can be found in /usr/ccs/bin.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Are there Grace binaries available? For which platforms?
           <label id="binaries"></heading>
      <p>
        We do not officially support binary packages. When contributed by
        volunteers they're put in under the <url name="contrib"
        url="ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/grace/contrib/"> area. Again,
        these are NOT supported (bug reports like "I can't install that RPM"
        will be silently ignored), but feel free using the Grace forums
        for relevant discussions.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Is there a Windows&verbar;OS/2&verbar;VMS port of Grace?</heading>
      <p>

        Yes, Grace runs on VMS. Just compile it there.

        As for Win32 (Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP) and OS/2, there are ports for
        these platforms, though they are not "native", i.e. in order to run
        them, one needs an X server for the respective platform.
        
        Both OS/2 and Win32 ports may lack some of the functionality (notably,
        support for "direct"/native printing; probably you will have to use
        the Postscript output for printing).

        A port to OS/2 made by Alexander Mai can be found
        at <url url="http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/">.
        It requires the XFree86 libraries and an X Server (e.g. XFree86,
	Hob X11, Exceed, etc.).
      </p>

    <sect1><heading>Compilation with gcc fails on Solaris complaining about unresolved symbols.</heading>
      <p>
        If you get such a message at the linkage stage, telling about
        .LL794 (or similar) unresolved symbols, try compiling with native
        cc compiler instead (./configure --with-cc=cc).

  <sect><heading>Runtime Problems</heading>

    <sect1><heading>When I start Grace I get the message
           ``Can't find library libXXX.so'' or similar.</heading>
      <p>
        For certain tasks, Grace needs external libraries which are
        neither provided by Grace nor the operating system. You will
        need to install these libraries yourself. This applies to
        M*tif, PDF (see question <ref id="export" name="Output Devices">)
        and probably other libraries.
        If the message is exactly <tt>Can't find library libXm.so</tt>
        (usually this happens on GNU/Linux systems ...) then you don't have
        M*tif (the Xm libraries) installed (see question
        <ref id="motif" name="M*tif">), or the linker doesn't
        know where it is.
        In the first case, try downloading LessTif. In the second case,
        you have to tell your linker  where it is (may be
        a platform-specific task). On GNU/Linux look at the file
        <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt>. It  contains pathnames of the directories
        where dynamic libraries are stored. Add (as root) your directory
        to this file and run <tt>ldconfig -v</tt>. Now the libraries
        should be in the list. If you're not root you may try
        to adjust the environment variable <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>
        to include the required pathname.

        For some versions of Motif, the ``soname'' (which
        identifies the version of the library and is stored
        somewhere in the library) on your computer doesn't match
        the soname of the library on the computer where your copy
        of Grace was compiled on. Then you should use a
        (semi)statically linked version or compile Grace on your
        computer.

        This means that Grace made an incorrect access to an X

        not-yet-correctly-implemented LessTif function (see question

<tscreen><verb>

        Grace uses either the <tt>GRACE_HOME</tt> environment variable

  <sect><heading>Basic Concepts</heading>

    <sect1><heading>What is a project?</heading>
      <p>

        A project is a file which contains all information necessary
        to restore a plot created by Grace.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Which data formats does Grace recognize?</heading>
      <p>

        You can read in several kinds of files where data is
        arranged in columns separated by spaces or tabs.

        Files which are not in simple x y format must have a line
        <tt>@TYPE xytype</tt> before the actual data, where xytype
        stands for the set type.  Refer to the User's Guide (question
        <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">) for details.
        Alternatively, the file format can be set with a command
        line switch.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>What is block data?</heading>
      <p>

        The option <tt>Read Block Data</tt> can be used to read in files
        where the values are organized in columns. You
        can interactively select the type of set to be created and
        which columns should be used.  Refer to the User's Guide
        (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">) for details.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>What is the NXY data type?</heading>
      <p>
        Strictly speaking, it's not a data format. Rather, you may want
        to use the relevant command line switch to read in a block data
        file and automatically assign the data columns to sets of the XY
        type so that the first column of the block data is used as X
        for all the sets and the rest of the data columns are assigned to Y's.
        Refer to the User's Guide
        (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">) for details.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>What is the Julian date?<label id="jdate"></heading>
      <p>
        The Julian date, not to be confused with the Julian
        calendar, is a format to represent the time in a single
        number. Julian Date 0 is a day way in the past, namely the
        1st January 4713 before Christ (don't ask me why). The
        following days are numbered sequentially, each day starting
        at noon.
        This numbering scheme is in wide use, especially in
        astronomy, and is used for the internal representation of
        dates in Grace.

        The <tt>convcal</tt> utility in <tt>$GRACE_HOME/bin/</tt> can
        be used for about any to Julian date convertion.

<!-- **************************************** -->

  <sect><heading>Using Grace</heading>

    <sect1><heading>How do I start Grace?</heading>
      <p>
        There are three ways to invoke Grace. The full-featured
        GUI-based version is called <tt>xmgrace</tt>. A batch-printing
        version is called <tt>gracebat</tt> (see question <ref
        id="gracebat" name="Gracebat">). A command-line interface mode
        is called <tt>grace</tt>.

        All three of them are usually located in <tt>$GRACE_HOME/bin/</tt>.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Where is gracebat? How does batch printing work?
           <label id="gracebat"></heading>
      <p>
        <tt>gracebat</tt> is simply a copy of Grace named <tt>gracebat</tt>
        or a symbolic link from <tt>gracebat</tt> to Grace. In the case
        of the symbolic link:

        <tt>ln -s xmgrace gracebat</tt>

        done wherever the Grace binary is located will do the trick
        (rehash or logout and login to make sure that <tt>gracebat</tt>
        shows up in your path). Executing <tt>gracebat</tt> with no
        command line parameters or data files will produce a
        hardcopy on the default printer.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>How can I customize the default appearance of Grace?
           <label id="custom"></heading>
      <p>
        There are several ways: the init files, X Resources, and
        environment (shell) variables. Please refer to the
        User's Guide (question <ref id="manual" name="User Guide">)
        for details.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Which environment variables does Grace use?
           <label id="environment"></heading>
      <p>
        There are few, the most important being <tt>GRACE_HOME</tt>.
        It specifies the directory where the Grace files (fonts,
        docs, libs, ...) are stored. Default is <tt>/usr/local/grace</tt>.
        
        You can set environment variables using (e.g.):

        <tt>export GRACE_HOME="/usr/local/grace"</tt>

        in bash and sh or

        <tt>setenv GRACE_HOME "/usr/local/grace"</tt>

        in tcsh and csh.

        Please refer to the User's Guide
        (question <ref id="manual" name="User Guide">)
        for description of all relevant variables.
      </p>
    </sect1>
        
    <sect1><heading>What command line options does Grace recognize?</heading>
      <p>
        Quite a few. You can display them with <tt>xmgrace -help</tt>.
        
        Or check for the man page xmgrace(1).
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Can one change the colour selecton for the menu,
           locator, tool, and status bars, and all the popup menus?</heading>
      <p>
        As with any X application, use the "-bg &lt;colorname&gt; -fg 
        &lt;another_colorname&gt;" command line flags. Or, define the
        relevant X resources:

<tscreen><verb>
XMgrace*foreground: ...
XMgrace*background: ...
</verb></tscreen>
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>What different kinds of sets can Grace plot?</heading>
      <p>
        The standard set is the regular (x,y) set, but there are
        others including error bars or descriptive strings. See the
        User's Guide (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">)
        for details.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>I'd like to plot data against an axis on the right (top) and
           another data set in a different scale against an axis on the
           left (bottom)</heading>
      <p>
        Use two overlaying graphs, one with a scale on the
        left(bottom), the other one on the right (top). Thus you
        can achieve the desired effect, but you'll need to pay
        close attention to which graph is the 'current'
        graph. This is also how to display a second scale on the
        top (right) side of the graph.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>How do I do polar plots?</heading>
      <p>

        The support for polar plots is currently being
        implemented, so you can expect polar plots to work
        soon. The polar coordinates can be selected from the
        <tt>"Plot/Graph Appearance"</tt> menu. Please refer to
        the User's Guide (question <ref id="manual" name="User Guide">)
        for details.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Can I use different fonts, symbols, font size, or
           sub/superscripts in Grace?</heading>
      <p>

        Yes, Grace has all these features. Wherever you can type a
        text in Grace, e.g. Axis labels, graph title, text from
        <tt>Plot->Drawing objects</tt>, etc., you can use all those
        features within the same text.  Please refer to the User
        Guide (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">) for
        details.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>How do I produce special characters (Umlauts) with Grace?</heading>
      <p>
        
        If you asked this question, then you are probably familiar with
        the issue of keymap modifying in X. Once you configured the key
        mapping (with the use of <tt>xmodmap</tt>), you can enter the
        extended characters from the keyboard in any text input field. If,
        in addition, the appropriate for your language font encoding is
        anything but ISO Latin1 (used in most Western Europe countries),
        you'll have to tell Grace so. See the
        <ref id="fonts" name="next question">.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Can I use my own fonts and/or encodings?  <label id="fonts"></heading>
      <p>

        Yes. Starting with version 5.0.1, you can use your own
        fonts, in addition to the standard 14 fonts which
        include Times-Roman, Helvetica, Courier, Symbols and Zapf
        Dingbats and come with Grace, and as a replacement for the
        default fonts (for the purporse of localization). As well,
        an alternative encoding scheme can be specified.

        Please refer to the User's Guide
        (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">) for details.
      </p>
    </sect1>
        

    <sect1><heading>At which precision is numerical data saved? How can I set
           the precision?</heading>
      <p>
        By default, numbers are saved with eight valid digits. To
        set your own precision, go to the Project's proeprties in the
        Explorer tool and alter the "Data format:" field with another string
        (in the <tt>printf(3)</tt> format).
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>When I save a project and then re-open it, the julian date
           values appear to be rounded to the nearest half day.</heading>
      <p>
        For time plots, the default precision may be insufficient. See the
        previous question on how to alter it.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>How do I read in project files created by Xmgr?</heading>
      <p>
        From Xmgr-4.1.2 on, each project file starts with a string
        giving the version number by which is was saved. These
        files should cause no problems. You can modify older files
        by inserting a version line at the beginning. For example,
        <tt>@VERSION 40102</tt> stands for version 4.1.2. If you have no
        idea what version of Xmgr your file was created with, try some.
        In most cases, 40102 would do the trick. Also, make sure to read
        the "Xmgr to Grace migration" section of the User's Guide
        (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">).
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>When I load a project saved with an earlier version of Xmgr
           (&lt;4.0), symbols of all (some) sets are drawn in black.</heading>
      <p>
        Make sure you added a valid <tt>@VERSION versionid</tt> line to the
        beginning of the file.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Can I import bitmap graphics into Grace?</heading>
      <p>
        Well, not yet. The import of images will be implemented
        in a future release.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Can I export Grace graphs to GIF&verbar;TIFF&verbar;
           PostScript&verbar;PDF etc? <label id="export"></heading>
      <p>
        PostScript (for printing), EPS (encapsulated PostScript; for the
        inclusion of graphics into e.g. LaTeX documents), MIF (for
        inclusion in FrameMaker) and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) are
        implemented by default.

        Additionally, if some extra libraries are installed, listed in the
        User's Guide (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">), the
        PNM (PBM/PGM/PPM), JPEG, PNG, and PDF backends will be built as
        well.
        
        You can get various other formats using netpbm and pstoedit.

        Bitmaps: Using the PNM device + the <tt>netpbm</tt> utils (available at
        e.g. <url url="ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/"> one can get TIFF,
        GIF, G3, BMP, PCX,...  (conversion can be done on the fly with
        appropriate filter definitions).

        Notice that the direct support of the GIF format is impossible
        due to the copyright policy of Unisys - it's not a technical
        problem. In fact it was supported in earlier versions but
        to avoid any legal problems this feature has been removed.

        One can use <url name="pstoedit" url="http://www.pstoedit.net/">
        to convert PS to a lot of other vector formats: MIF, CGM,
        xfig's, tgif's, Windoze and OS/2 metafiles,... even Java
        applets!
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>Where have all the region operations gone to?</heading>
      <p>
        Region operations have no meaning by themselves. Regions are
        restriction conditions applied to data set(s) which a
        transformation is performed on. For example, to kill data points in
        a region, use "Evaluate expression", select same source and dest
        set(s), leave the "formula" field empty, select your region in the
        "Restriction" menu, check "Negated".
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>How can I input data in date/time formats?</heading>
      <p>

        You can use several date/time formats in input data files.
        Make sure, however, that the time fields don't contain space
        separators inside, e.g. 1999-12-31-23:59:59.5
        
        Also, you can use an external program to convert the data into the
        <ref id="jdate" name="Julian Date"> format, like the one (convcal)

    <sect1><heading>How do I use more than 16 colors for objects/lines in Grace?</heading>
      <p>
       You may edit your Default.xgr file in
       <tt>$GRACE_HOME/templates</tt>. Just add lines similar to
       <verb> &lt;color-def id="2" rgb="#ff0000" name="red"/&gt; </verb>
       defining a RGB value and an according name for that color triplet.

    <sect1><heading>How can I use pipes with Grace?</heading>
      <p>

        A named pipe is a pseudo file to which one application
        writes data which another one reads from it.

        Applications like measurement programs can write data to a
        pipe and make it thus available to Grace which reads from
        the pipe. So Grace can serve as data displayer for otherwise
        non-graphical programs.

        Refer to the User's Guide (question <ref id="manual"
          name="User's Guide">) for further information.

    <sect1><heading>Printing to my old PostScript printer produces an error.</heading>
      <p>
        By default, the PS driver uses Level 2 features, while your
        printer may not be PostScript Level 2 compliant. You can force
        the use of PS Level 1 only features in the PostScript device setup,
        though output may be not exactly as expected (there will be no
        pattern fills, for example).

    <sect1><heading>How do I make a Grace image fit on a given paper size?</heading>
      <p>
        Select the correct paper size in the <tt>Device setup</tt>
        popup.

        You can also try the command psresize from the
        <url name="psutils package"
        url="http://www.knackered.org/angus/psutils/"> in order to
        resize a Postscript file generated by Grace.

    <sect1><heading>My decimal tick labels are systematically of the form e.g.
           0,5 instead of 0.5 (i.e. I get a comma instead of a dot).</heading>
      <p>
        You're using a localized version of OS. You have either LANG or
        LC_NUMERIC shell variables set, so Grace uses the locale setting to
        produce numeric labels. Set at least LC_NUMERIC to C or POSIX to
        disable this behaviour. Notice that there is nothing specific to
        Grace about locale. Either you want the localization or not. Setting
        by default LANG to anything but C/POSIX assumes you do.

    <sect1><heading>Is it possible to use the dB (decibel) axis scale?</heading>
      <p>
        In "Explorer", select the relevant axis, enable logarithmic axis
        scaling, then go to the "Tick labels" tab of this dialog, find the
        "Axis transform" input field in the "Extra" frame, and enter there
        "10*log10(10*$t)" (w/o quotes, of course).

    <sect1><heading>In "Data set properties", I don't see a possibility to view the
           more essential part of the mantissa; it's swallowed in the black
           triangle.</heading>
      <p>
        If you find some columns are too narrow to show all significant
        digits, you can drag the vertical rules using Shift+Button 2.

    <sect1><heading>I am unable to find "Load &amp; Evaluate" which I used quite a
           lot with Xmgr.</heading>
      <p>
        Use "Create new-&gt;By formula" from any set selector popup menu.
      </p>
    </sect1>
 
    <sect1><heading>How can I specify a template other than the default one on
           the command line?</heading>
      <p>
        Template is just an empty (in the sense that there are no data sets)
        but otherwise a valid project file. So just put your favorite
        template's filename as the first argument on the command line.
      </p>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><heading>How can I save my 'preferences' options?</heading>
      <p>
        A part of them are saved with the project; most of the rest are
        available via command-line options and/or X resources. A more
        homogeneous approach will be implemented soon.

    <sect1><heading>What algorithm is used for non-linear curve fitting?</heading>
      <p>
        It is the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, based on LMDIF from
        MINPACK, with some modifications.

    <sect1><heading>Can Grace plot 3D graphs?</heading>
      <p>
        No. Not yet, I should say. Be patient. It may take quite a
        while to implement it, though.

    <sect1><heading>Which features are planned for the future?</heading>
      <p>
        Among the many features planned to be introduced in the
        future are contour plots, image import and
        manipulations, a library for 2-way communication, ... Then 3D plots
        would come :-)
