<!-- **************************************** -->

    <sect>General Questions
      <p>

      <sect1>What is Grace?
	<p>

	  Grace is a tool to make two-dimensional plots of scientific
	  data. It runs under various (if not all) flavours of UNIX
	  with X11 and Motif. Its capabilities are roughly similar to
	  GUI-based programs like Sigmaplot or Microcal Origin plus
	  script-based tools like Gnuplot or Genplot.  Its strength
	  lies in the fact that it combines the convenience of a
	  graphical user interface with the power of a scripting
	  language which enables it to do sophisticated calculations
	  or perform automated tasks.

	  Grace is derived from Xmgr (a.k.a. ACE/gr), originally
	  written by <url name="Paul Turner"
	  url="mailto:pturner@teleport.com">.

	  From version number 4.00, the development was taken over by
	  a team of volunteers under the coordination of <url
	  name="Evgeny Stambulchik"
	  url="mailto:fnevgeny@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il">.

	  See question <ref id="mailinglist" name="Mailing Lists"> on
	  how to contact the developers.
	  
          When its copyright was changed to GPL, the name was changed to Grace,
          which stands for ``GRaphing, Advanced Computation and Exploration of
          data'' or ``Grace Revamps ACE/gr''. The first version of Grace
          available is named 5.0.0, while the last public version of Xmgr has
          the version number 4.1.2.

	  Paul still maintains and develops a non-public version of
	  Xmgr for internal use.

      <sect1>Where can I get Grace?
	<p>

	  You can get the newest information about Grace and download
	  the latest version at the <url
	    url="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/" name="Grace
	    home page">.

	  You can fetch it from a mirror site as well. The list of
	  mirror sites can be found at <url
	    url="ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/grace/MIRRORS">.

      <sect1>What is the current version of Grace? <label id="current">
	<p>

	  Grace is still in the "beta" phase. The current
	  official release is 5.0.2 from March, 1999.

      <sect1>Where can I get the most recent information about Grace? <label id="homepage">
	<p>

	  Please refer to the <url name="official Grace Home Page"
	    url="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">. There you
	  can also find the latest version of this FAQ, links to the
	  latest release and to mirror sites closer to you.

      <sect1>What is the difference between Xmgr and Grace?
	<p>

          Apart from the licensing, the main difference is that Grace is
          WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). This was achieved through a
          major rewrite of all the mid-level drawing routines and the use of
          the device-independent Type 1 font rendering library T1lib written by
          <url name="Rainer Menzner"
          url="mailto:Rainer.Menzner@neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bochum.de">. See
          question <ref id="t1lib" name="T1lib"> for more information about
          T1lib.

	  For help with changing from Xmgr to Grace see section 
          <tt/Xmgr to Grace migration guide/ in the
          User's Guide (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">.

	  As Grace is still under development, there are currently
	  several features of Xmgr which are not yet implemented in
	  Grace. A full compatibility is desirable except for ``bad''
	  features of Xmgr.

	  Among the Xmgr features not (yet) implemented in Grace are:

	  <itemize>

	    <item>Horizontal and vertical lines as symbols.

	    <item>Smith plots.

	    <item>Box plot sets.

	  </itemize>

      <sect1>Why did you change the name?
	<p>

	  When the licensing was changed to GPL, Paul wanted to keep
	  the name for his non-public version of Xmgr, so we chose a
	  new name.

      <sect1>Is Grace free?
	<p>

	  Yes. Grace is free in terms of the GNU General Public
	  License (GPL) (see the file <tt/LICENSE/ which comes with
	  Grace or the <url url="http://www.gnu.org" name="GNU Home
	  Page"> for details).

      <sect1>Who wrote Grace?
	<p>

	  The sources of Grace still contain lots of code from Xmgr by
	  Paul Turner. For a list of those who contributed to Grace
	  since then, see the file <tt/CHANGES/ in the Grace
	  distribution.

      <sect1>Is there a Postscript&verbar;LaTeX&verbar;HTML&verbar;SGML
          version of this document?
	<p>

	  Yes. It is written in SGML which means that all the above
	  versions can easily be created using <tt/sgml-tools/ (see
	  their <url name="home page"
	  url="http://www.sgmltools.org/">). At the Grace home page
	  (see question <ref id="homepage" name="Home Page">), all
	  these versions are available.

      <sect1>Who maintains the FAQ?
	<p>

          Until recently, the FAQ had been maintained by <url name="Heiko
          Selber" url="mailto:selber@fhi-berlin.mpg.de">. There is no
          "official" maintainer right now. If you'd like to take the job,
          please let us know.

<!-- **************************************** -->

    <sect>Getting Help
      <p>

      <sect1>Is there any Literature about Grace?
	<p>

          As of now, Grace is a purely virtual creature living in the net, i.e.
          there is no printed literature. All relevant literature is currently
          bundled with Grace. See questions <ref id="homepage" name="Home
          Page"> and <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide"> for details. You can
          print your own copy of the FAQ, the User's Guide and the Tutorial by
          converting the DVI files to postscript output.

      <sect1>Is there a User's Guide available for Grace? <label id="manual">
	<p>

	  Yes. It is part of the Grace distribution and usually is
	  located in <tt>$GRACE_HOME/doc/</tt>.  There are several
	  versions: the SGML source and HTML, LaTeX, DVI and PS
	  derived from it. You can read the HTML version from a
	  running Grace session by clicking on <tt>"Help/User
	  Guide"</tt>. You need a web browser to read the HTML version
	  (see also question <ref id="environment" name="Environment
	  Variables">). You can always download the newest version
	  from the Grace homepage (see question <ref id="homepage"
	  name="Home Page">).

	  The User's Guide is currently quite incomplete, though.

      <sect1>Is there a Tutorial available for Grace? <label id="tutorial">
	<p>

	  Yes. There are several tutorials which give detailed
	  step-by-step information how to achieve various tasks. They
	  are also part of the Grace distribution. You can find them
	  in <tt>$GRACE_HOME/doc/</tt>.

	  There are tutorials about creating a simple plot, batch
	  plotting, fitting curves, transformations (graphical -
	  simple ones, interpolation, feature extraction, using the
	  command line), using pipes, overlaying graphs, hot links.

      <sect1>Where do I get support for Grace? <label id="support">
	<p>

	  You have the following options:

	  <itemize>

	    <item>There is a User's Guide (see question <ref id="manual"
		name="User's Guide">) which came with Grace on your
		computer. It is usually located in
		<tt>$GRACE_HOME/doc/</tt> along with other files which
		may contain useful help for your problem. If you
		downloaded the sources, there are even more files in
		the main directory of the source tree.

	    <item>Have a look at the Grace home page (question <ref
		id="homepage" name="Home Page">).

	    <item>On the Grace mailing list (see question <ref
		id="mailinglist" name="Mailing Lists"> for details)
	      you can easily get in contact with users and
	      developers of Grace.

	  </itemize>

      <sect1>Is there a newsgroup devoted to Grace?
	<p>

	  No, there isn't. We feel that a mailing list (see question
	  <ref id="mailinglist" name="Mailing Lists">) is more
	  appropriate to discuss the topics related to Grace as long
	  the volume of the lists stays low enough.

      <sect1>Is there a mailing list for Grace?<label id="mailinglist">
	<p>

	  Yes.  Grace has three mailing lists: <tt/grace/,
	  <tt/grace-announce/ and <tt/grace-dev/.

	  See question <ref id="subscription" name="Subscription"> for
	  details on how to subscribe.

	  <descrip>

	    <tag/grace/ The first one, unmoderated, serves for general
	      discussions about Grace. This is the list your message
	      should go to if you have a question about
	      Grace. Currently, the volume of this list is about a
	      dozen messages per week.

	      If you want to write an email to the list, use the
	      address <htmlurl name="grace@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il"
	      url="mailto:grace@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il">. This
	      address is <bf/not/ for subscription or unsubscription.

	      Virtually all developers and most users of Grace have
	      subscribed to this list. So you can be pretty sure that
	      there will be at least one who can help you.

	      <bf/But:/ no one likes to read the same questions over
	      and over again. So, please refer to other sources of
	      help (see question <ref id="support" name="Support">)
	      before asking something that can be found in the
	      documentation.

	      Instead of subscribing to the list itself you may wish
	      to subscribe to the digest of the list. The digest is
	      sent once in three days or when its size exceeds 32K.

	    <tag/grace-announce/ The moderated grace-announce list is
	      for new version or serious bug fix announcements only
	      (which are automatically relayed to the first mailing
	      list, too). The volume of this list is very low, like
	      once a month or less.

	    <tag/grace-dev/ The grace-dev mailing list is for
	      developers. It serves for discussions about the future
	      development or details which are usually not interesting
	      to mere users.

	  </descrip>

	  There are <url name="mailing list archives"
	    url="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/maillists/">
	  available for browsing.

      <sect1>How do I subscribe to the mailing lists?<label id="subscription">
	<p>

	  You can subscribe to any of the Grace mailing lists by
	  sending an email to
	  <tt/&lt;LISTNAME>-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/ with
	  no subject line and the only word <tt/`Subscribe'/ (without
	  quotes, of course) in the body of the message.

	  <tt/&lt;LISTNAME>/ stands for the name of the list you wish
	  to subscribe to, i.e. <tt/grace/, <tt/grace-digest/,
	  <tt/grace-announce/ or <tt/grace-devel/

	  So the respective addresses are:

	  <htmlurl name="grace-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il"
	    url="mailto:grace-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il">

	  <htmlurl name="grace-digest-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il"
	    url="mailto:grace-digest-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il">

	  <htmlurl name="grace-announce-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il"
	    url="mailto:grace-announce-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il">

	  <htmlurl name="grace-dev-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il"
	    url="mailto:grace-dev-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il">

	  To unsubscribe from a list, same instructions apply, with
	  <tt/`Subscribe'/ being replaced by <tt/`Unsubscribe'/.

    <sect>Providing Help: Finding and Reporting Bugs
      <p>

      <sect1>I think I found a bug in Grace! How do I report it?
	<p>

	  <descrip>

	    <tag/First/ Make sure that what you found really is a bug.

	    <tag/Second/ Try to make sure that it is a bug in Grace,
	      and that the failure is not caused by another piece of
	      software.

	    <tag/Third/ Consider upgrading to the newest release of
	      Grace (see question <ref id="current" name="Current
	      Release">). The development of Grace is currently rather
	      fast, so your bug might already be fixed.

	    <tag/Fourth/ Try to find out if the bug is already known
	      (see question <ref id="w3todo" name="Known Bugs">).

	    <tag/Fifth/ OK: You <em/have/ found a new bug. Use
	      <bf/w3todo/ (question <ref id="w3todo" name="Known
	      Bugs">) to report it. Follow the instructions on the
	      page and try to be as precise as possible. It won't be
	      much help if you write ``The program crashes.'' Try to
	      find a simple reproducible case. Mention the version of
	      Grace and where you got the build and the operating system
	      you use. You should submit the system info as provided by
	      ``uname -a'' (if on a un*x system) and the output of
	      ``xmgrace -version'' (this works only for recent versions).
	      Once you submit the bug report, it will be automatically
	      sent to the mailing list. You will usually be notified when
	      the bug is fixed or if we need more information, so don't forget
	      to give your correct e-mail address.

	  </descrip>


      <sect1>Is there a list of known bugs? <label id="w3todo">
	<p>

	  Yes. You can search and browse the database of known bugs in
	  Xmgr and Grace at the bug report facility <url name="w3todo"
	  url="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/w3todo/index.phtml">
	  or using the <tt>"Help/Comments"</tt> menu from within
	  Grace.  The database also keeps track of the status of the
	  bug (<tt/Confirmed, Working on, Testing, Fixed, Closed,/
	  etc.). This is also the place to submit bug reports and
	  wishes.

      <sect1>The bug report #xxx is marked as "fixed" in the w3todo, but I
             checked the last version of Grace and the bug is still there!
	<p>
             
          The term "fixed" means the bug is fixed in the current 
          <it>development</it> version, and the next <it>public</it> version
          will have the fix in it. Reports with fixes incorporated in an
          existing public version are marked as "closed".

      <sect1>I have got an idea! How do I report a wish?
	<p>

	  You can submit wishes and suggestions just the way you would
	  submit bug reports (see question <ref id="w3todo"
	  name="Known Bugs">).  Suggestions for improvement are
	  generally very welcome. It may be possible, however, that
	  the developers are busy or that your wish is rejected for
	  some good reason, so it may be necessary to persuade (better
	  convince) them to get at it.

      <sect1>I want to help! How can I contribute to grace?
	<p>

	  Fine! There are always things to do.

	  If you are a c programmer, you can almost certainly find
	  something useful to do. Just ask the mailing list. The same
	  applies if you are a technical writer. The documentation
	  will certainly need to be updated, corrected or completed.

	  Make Grace known to your friends and colleagues. The more
	  users Grace has, the faster it will be improved.

      <sect1>I like Grace! Can I donate anything to its authors?
	<p>

	  No need to (yet). But if you feel like making a donation,
	  choose any charity organization you like. You wanted to give
	  them some money, anyway, right?

<!-- **************************************** -->

    <sect>Installation
      <p>

      <sect1>How do I install Grace? <label id="install">
	<p>

	  You have the choice: either you compile the sources yourself
	  or you download precompiled binaries. You can get both from
	  the <url url="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/"
	  name="Grace Home Page">. Whether binaries for your platforms
	  are available (see question <ref id="binaries"
	  name="Binaries">) depends on whether one of the developers
	  has access to the respective platform and has had time to do
	  it.

	  It is always a good idea to read the <tt/README/s that accompany
          the downloading packages of Grace.

<!-- **************************************** -->

      <sect1>Compilation
	<p>

	<sect2>What do I need in order to compile Grace?
	  <p>

            Grace usually compiles out of the box on a regular UNIX machine.
            You need an ANSI C compiler (gcc is just fine), the X11R5 or above
            libraries and headers, and Motif-1.2 or above (see question
            <ref id="motif" name="Motif">).

	    You also need certain libraries if you want to export
	    special file formats (see question <ref id="export"
	    name="Output Devices">).

	    In order to read/write sets in the netCDF data format, you
	    will also need the <url name="NetCDF libraries"
	    url="http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html">.

	    Furthermore, you might use the XPM libraries for the Grace
	    icon from the <url name="XPM home page"
	    url="http://www.inria.fr/koala/lehors/xpm.html"> and the
	    FFTW libraries for fast Fourier transformations from the
	    <url name="FFTW home page"
	    url="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~fftw/">.

	    If you want to compile your own changes to certain parts
	    of Grace, you will need a parser generator (<tt/yacc/ or
	    <tt/bison/).

	    Most of these (except Motif and probably T1lib and FFTW)
	    are usually part of a regular Linux distribution but
	    probably not of other UNIXes.

	<sect2>How do I compile Grace?
	  <p>

	    After getting the sources (question <ref id="install"
	    name="Installation">) and un<tt/gzip/ping and un<tt/tar/ing
	    them (use e.g. <tt/gzip -dc grace-5.0.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -/),
            change to the Grace directory and have a look at the files
            <tt/README/ and <tt/README.configure/.

	    Type <tt>./configure</tt>. This checks for the
	    availability of libraries and other stuff on your
	    system. If all went well, two new files, <tt/Make.conf/
            and <tt/config.h/, are created. In very rare cases you may
            want to manually edit them.

	    Type <tt/make/. When the compilation is finished, you can
	    test Grace using <tt/make tests/. This will give you a
	    slide show demonstrating some nice features of Grace. Then
	    install it to the directory <tt>$GRACE_HOME/</tt> (see
	    question <ref id="environment" name="Environment
	    Variables">) using <tt/make install/ (probably as root).

	<sect2>When I type './configure' I get: ``configure: warning:
            Motif has not been found; building a GUI-less version''
	  <p>

	    Check whether Motif (question <ref id="motif"
	    name="Motif">) is installed on your system. If it is, look
	    at the file config.log: there is a line like this:

	    <tt/configure:5569: checking for main in -lXm/

	    What comes directly after it? Could be a hint.

	    Use configure with the special
	    <tt/--with-motif-includes=DIR/ and
	    <tt/--with-motif-libraries=DIR/ options.

	<sect2>What is Motif (LessTif)? <label id="motif">
	  <p>

	    Motif is a toolkit library for X11. It provides widgets
	    (buttons, boxes, etc) to be used in graphical user
	    interfaces. Graces makes heavy use of Motif. The original
	    OSF Motif (see <url url="http://www.osf.org">) is <em/not/
	    free. You can buy it from several vendors (at approx. $100
	    for Linux).

            There is, however, a free replacement for Motif called LessTif (see
            <url url="http://www.lesstif.org">). LessTif is intended to be a
            100% source(!) compatible replacement for Motif, but is still under
            development, so don't expect everything to work exactly as it
            should. For the purposes of Grace, try using the latest version of
            LessTif (at least 0.88 and above) - if you don't
            mind that it might be a bit slower than commercial versions of Motif
	    and graphical details may be different. Be aware, however, that
            occasional crashes might occur under certain circumstances. The
            LessTif people usually receive many bug reports from the Grace
            developers, so you might hope that bugs in LessTif will be fixed
	    rather quickly.
            In addition to the source compatibility it may work with
            binaries prepared for real Motif (binary compatibility).
	    This is not guaranteed at all and you also have to install the
	    correct version (compatible to either Motif 1.2 or 2.0).
	    Most Lesstif binary packages ship only with the 1.2 version,
	    so you might have to build the 2.0 version yourself. To build Grace
	    from its sources you only need the Motif 1.2 compatible version.

	<sect2>While compiling Grace I get error messages about missing include files.
	  <p>

	    The answer to this question varies: 

	    <itemize>

	      <item> The include files are there but in a non-standard
		place. Check with your local sys admin.

	      <item> If the missing files are like Xm/*.h, this means
		you don't have Motif development kit installed (or
		again, you have to tell explicitly to compiler where
		to look for the header files). This mostly concerns
		Linux.

	    </itemize>

	<sect2>`configure' stops telling it can't find "ar".
	  <p>

            "ar" is the library archiver (the program used to create static
            libraries like libFoo.a). You should have it in your path. Under
            Solaris, for example, this can be found in /usr/ccs/bin.


<!-- **************************************** -->

      <sect1>Are there Grace binaries available? For which platforms? <label id="binaries">
	<p>

	  You will find binaries for several flavours of UNIX and probably
          a Win32 package at <url
	  url="ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/grace/bin/">.

      <sect1>Is there a Windows&verbar;OS/2&verbar;VMS port of Grace?
	<p>

	  Yes, Grace runs on VMS. Just compile it there.

          As for Win32 (Windows 95/98/NT) and OS/2, there are ports for these
          platforms, though they are not "native", i.e. in order to run them,
          one needs an X server for respective platform.
          
          Both OS/2 and Win32 ports lack some of the functionality (notably,
          direct printing). A Win32 package should be available at
          <url url="ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/grace/bin/win32/">.

	  A port to OS/2 made by <url name="Alexander Mai"
	    url="mailto:st002279@hrzpub.tu-darmstadt.de"> can be found

    <sect>Using Grace
      <p>

      <sect1>How do I start Grace?
	<p>

	  There are three ways to invoke Grace. The full-featured
	  GUI-based version is called <tt/xmgrace/. A batch-printing
	  version is called <tt/gracebat/ (see question <ref
	  id="gracebat" name="Gracebat">). A command-line interface mode
          is called <tt/grace/.

	  Both are usually located in <tt>$GRACE_HOME/bin/</tt>.

      <sect1>Does Grace have an UNDO function?
	<p>

	  No. Sorry. Although it would be nice to have such a
	  function, it is very hard to implement. We can only ask you
	  to be careful with certain actions and remember to <tt/save
	  often and early (TM)/.

      <sect1>Settings
	<p>

	<sect2>How can I customize the default appearance of Grace? <label id="custom">
	  <p>

	    There are several ways:

	    <descrip>

	      <tag/X Resources/ Grace reads several X Resources on
		startup. These resources affect only the appearance of
		the GUI, not the printed graphs. Please refer to the
		User's Guide (question <ref id="manual" name="User
		Guide">) for details.

	      <tag>The init file &tilde;/.grace/gracerc</tag> This
		file is in fact a Grace parameter file (question <ref
		id="parameter" name="Parameter File">) which is read
		when Grace starts. It can contain anything a parameter
		file may contain. You can write this file by creating
		a graph which looks the way you want and then save it
		to &tilde;/.gracerc. Be aware that this defines the
		default for one graph only. If you want to set the
		defaults for more than one graph, you have to define
		each of them explicitely, even if you want them to
		look the same.

	    </descrip>

	    In the future, there will be still another way to define
	    defaults.

	<sect2>Which environment variables does Grace use? <label id="environment">
	  <p>

	    <descrip>

	      <tag/GRACE_HOME/ Specifies the directory where the Grace
		docs and libs are stored. Default is
		<tt>/usr/local/grace</tt>.

	      <tag/GRACE_HELPVIEWER/ Specifies the browser which is
		used to display the Grace HTML help pages. Default is
		<tt>netscape</tt>.

	      <tag/GRACE_EDITOR/ Specifies the editor which is used to
		edit sets. Default is <tt>vi</tt> in an <tt/xterm/.

	      <tag/GRACE_PRINT_CMD/ The print command.

	      <tag/GRACE_FFTW_RAM_WISDOM and GRACE_FFTW_WISDOM_FILE/ A
		flag (0 or 1) and a file name which determine whether
		a FFT should use ``wisdom'' when using the FFTW
		libraries.

	    </descrip>

	    You can set environment variables using (e.g.):

	    <tt>export GRACE_HOME="/usr/local/grace"</tt>

	    in bash and sh or

	    <tt>setenv GRACE_HOME "/usr/local/grace"</tt>

	    in tcsh and csh.

	<sect2>What command line options does Grace recognize?
	  <p>

	    Quite a few. You can display them with <tt/xmgrace -help/.

	<sect2>I work with the 800x600 screen resolution and several popups are
            too large to fit in my desktop.
	  <p>

            The window sizes are proportional to the font size used which by
            default is set to be optimal for the resolution most people are
            using, i.e. 1024x768. For a lower resolution, set font sizes to a
            smaller value, e.g. put it in your .Xresources (or like) file:

<tscreen><verb>
XMgrace*fontList: -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal-*-8-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
XMgrace*tabFontList: -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal-*-8-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
</verb></tscreen>

	<sect2>Can one change the colour selecton for the menu,
               locator, tool and status bars, and all the popup menues?
	  <p>

            As with any X application, use the "-bg &lt;colorname&gt; -fg 
            &lt;another_colorname&gt;" command line flags. Or, define the
            relevant X resources:

<tscreen><verb>
XMgrace*foreground: ...
XMgrace*background: ...
</verb></tscreen>
            

      <sect1>Plotting
	<p>

	<sect2>I'd like to plot data against an axis on the right (top) and another data set in a different scale against an axis on the left (bottom)
	  <p>
	    
	    Use two overlaying graphs, one with a scale on the
	    left(bottom), the other one on the right (top). Thus you
	    can achieve the desired effect, but you'll need to pay
	    close attention to which graph is the 'current'
	    graph. This is also how to display a second scale on the
	    top (right) side of the graph.

	<sect2>How do I do polar plots?
	  <p>

	    The support for polar plots is currently being
	    implemented, so you can expect polar plots to work
	    soon. The polar coordinates can be selected from the
	    <tt>"Plot/Graph Appearance"</tt> menu.  Please refer to
	    the User's Guide (question <ref id="manual" name="User
	    Guide">) for details.

      <sect1>Strings
	<p>

	<sect2>Can I use different fonts, symbols, font size, or sub/superscripts in Grace?
	  <p>

	    Yes, Grace has all these features. Wherever you can type a
	    text in Grace, e.g. Axis labels, graph title, text from
	    <tt/Plot->Drawing objects/, etc., you can use all those
	    features within the same text.  Please refer to the User
	    Guide (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">) for
	    details.

	<sect2>What is T1lib good for? <label id="t1lib">
	  <p>

	    T1lib is a font rasterer library which permits to use nice
	    Type1 fonts within Grace on all output media. Usually, the
	    newest version of T1lib comes bundled with Grace, so you
	    don't need to take care of it. If you're interested: the
	    author is <url name="Rainer Menzner"
	    url="mailto:Rainer.Menzner@neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bochum.de">
	    and you can get more info on t1lib at <url
	    url="http://www.neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ini/PEOPLE/rmz/t1lib.html">.

	<sect2>How do I produce special characters (Umlauts) with Grace?
	  <p>
            
            If you asked this question, then you are probably familiar with
            the issue of keymap modifying in X. Once you configured the key
            mapping (with the use of <tt/xmodmap/), you can enter the extended
            characters from the keyboard in any text input field. If,
            in addition, the appropriate for your language font encoding is
            anything but ISO Latin1 (used in most Western Europe countries),
            you'll have to tell Grace so. See the
            <ref id="fonts" name="next question">.

	<sect2>Can I use my own fonts and/or encodings?  <label id="fonts">
	  <p>

	    Yes. Starting with version 5.0.1, you can use your own
	    fonts, in addition to the standard 14 fonts which
	    include Times-Roman, Helvetica, Courier, Symbols and Zapf
	    Dingbats and come with Grace, and as a replacement for the
            default fonts (for the purporse of localization). As well,
            an alternative encoding scheme can be specified.

            Please refer to the User's Guide
            (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">) for details.
            

      <sect1>Files
	<p>

	<sect2>At which precision is numerical data saved? How can I set the precision?
	  <p>

	    By default, numbers are saved with eight valid digits. To
	    set your own precision, use the command

	    <tt/DEFAULT SFORMAT formatstring/

	    (e.g. in your <tt/.gracerc/, see question <ref id="custom"
	      name="Customization">) with formatstring being in the
	    <tt/printf(3)/ format.

	<sect2>Grace cannot find help files.
	  <p>

	    Set the <tt/GRACE_HOME/ environment variable to your Grace
	    directory. The help files are in
	    <tt>$GRACE_HOME/doc</tt>. See question <ref
	    id="environment" name="Environment Variables"> on how to
	    set environment variables.

	<sect2>How do I read in project files created by Xmgr or older versions of Grace?
	  <p>

	    From Xmgr-4.1.2 on, each project file starts with a string
	    giving the version number by which is was saved. These
	    files should cause no problems. You can modify older files
	    by inserting a version line at the beginning. For example,
	    <tt/@VERSION 40102/ stands for version 4.1.2.

	<sect2>I can't open anymore project files saved with an old version of Xmgr.
	  <p>

	    In Xmgr-4.1.0, support for the binary file format (the
	    former default one) was dropped. You must use the
	    <tt/grconvert/ utility supplied with the Grace
	    distribution in order to convert the files. This can
	    easily be achieved defining an input filter like in the
	    <tt/gracerc/ sample file which comes with Grace.

	<sect2>How do I save disk space? Can I use compressed project files?
	  <p>

	    Yes. You can use your favorite compression program
	    (e.g. `gzip') as input or output filter so that files on
	    disk are automagically (de)compressed. Just add the lines

	    <tt/DEFINE IFILTER "gzip -dc %s" PATTERN "*.gz"/

	    and

	    <tt/DEFINE OFILTER "gzip - &gt;  %s" PATTERN "*.gz"/

	    into your personal grace init file. Then, everytime you
	    specify a file name that ends with <tt/.gz/, gzip is used
	    as input and output filters. You can use this mechanism to
	    do other things, e.g. reading and storing files into a
	    database.

	<sect2>Can I import bitmap graphics into Grace?
	  <p>

	    Well, not yet. The import of images will be implemented
	    in a future release.

	<sect2>Can I export Grace graphs to GIF&verbar;TIFF&verbar;
               PostScript&verbar;PDF etc? <label id="export">
	  <p>

	    PostScript (for printing), EPS (encapsulated
	    PostScript; for the inclusion of graphics into e.g. LaTeX
	    documents) and PNM (PBM/PGM/PPM) are implemented by default.

	    Additionally, if the <url name="IJG's JPEG library 6.x"
            url="ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/">
            is installed, the JPEG backend will be built as well.

	    Additionally, the PNG driver can be built if the
            <url name="libpng library"
            url="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/"> is installed.
            
	    For PDF output, you need pdflib-2.0. The PDFlib
	    distribution is available at <url name="the PDFlib home
	    page" url="http://www.ifconnection.de/~tm/pdflib">.

	    You can get various other formats using netpbm and pstoedit.

	    Bitmaps: Using the PNM device + the <tt/netpbm/ utils
	    (available at e.g. <url
	    url="ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/"> one can get
	    TIFF, GIF, G3, BMP, PCX,...  (conversion can be done on
	    the fly with appropriate filter definitions).

            Notice that the direct support of the GIF format is impossible
            due to the copyright policy of Unisys - it's not a technical
            problem.

	    One can use <tt/pstoedit/ (available at several places,
	    e.g. <url
	    url="ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/applications/pstoedit/">) to
	    convert PS to a lot of other vector formats: MIF, CGM,
	    xfig's, tgif's, Windoze and OS/2 metafiles,... even Java
	    applets!


<!-- **************************************** -->

      <sect1>Colors
	<p>

	<sect2>When I load a project saved with an earlier version of Xmgr (&lt;4.0), symbols of all (some) sets are drawn in black.
	  <p>

	    Make sure you added a valid <tt/@VERSION versionid/ line to the
            beginning of the file.

	<sect2>How do I set the background color of a plot, outside of the graph frame?
	  <p>

	    This can be done using the <tt>"Plot/Plot appearance"</tt> popup.

            This changes the background of the entire canvas, not only
	    the background of graphs.

        <sect2>How do I use more than 16 colors for objects/lines in grace?
          <p>

           You may edit your Default.agr file in
           <tt>$GRACE_HOME/templates</tt>. Just add lines similar to
           <verb> @map color 2 to (255, 0, 0), "red" </verb> defining a RGB
           value and an according name for that color triplet.


<!-- **************************************** -->

    <sect>Basic Concepts
      <p>

      <sect1>What is a project?
	<p>

	  A project is a file which contains all information necessary
	  to restore a Graph created by Grace.

      <sect1>What is a parameter file? <label id="parameter">
	<p>

	  A parameter file contains informations about settings. Every
	  batch command of Grace is a valid line in a parameter
	  file. A parameter file is essentially a project file without
	  sets in a slightly different format (i.e. without leading
	  <tt/@/s).

      <sect1>Which data formats does Grace recognize?
	<p>

	  You can read in several kinds of files where data is
	  arranged in columns separated by spaces or tabs.

	  Files which are not in simple x y format must have a line
	  <tt>@TYPE xytype</tt> before the actual data, where xytype
	  stands for the set type.  Refer to the User's Guide (question
	  <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">) for details.
	  Alternatively, the file format can be set with a command
	  line switch.

      <sect1>What is block data?
	<p>

	  The option <tt/Read Block Data/ can be used to read in files
	  where the values are organized in columns. You
	  can interactively select the type of set to be created and
	  which columns should be used.  Refer to the User's Guide
	  (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">) for details.

      <sect1>What is the NXY data type?
	<p>

	  Strictly speaking, it's not a data format. Rather, you may want
          to use the relevant command line switch to read in a block data
          file and automatically assign the data columns to sets of the XY
          type so that the first column of the block data is used as X
          for all the sets and the rest of the data columns are assigned to Y's.
          Refer to the User's Guide
	  (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">) for details.

      <sect1>How can I use pipes with Grace?
	<p>

	  A named pipe is a pseudo file to which one application
	  writes data which another one reads from it.

	  Applications like measurement programs can write data to a
	  pipe and make it thus available to Grace which reads from
	  the pipe. So Grace can serve as data displayer for otherwise
	  non-graphical programs.

	  Refer to the User's Guide (question <ref id="manual"
	    name="User's Guide">) or the tutorials (question <ref
	    id="tutorial" name="Tutorials">) for further information.

	  One example for using pipes is included in the <tt/`make
	  tests'/ slide show.

      <sect1>Where is gracebat? How does batch printing work? <label id="gracebat">
	<p>

	  <tt/gracebat/ is simply a copy of Grace named <tt/gracebat/
	  or a symbolic link from <tt/gracebat/ to Grace. In the case
	  of the symbolic link:

	  <tt/ln -s xmgrace gracebat/

	  done wherever the Grace binary is located will do the trick
	  (rehash or logout and login to make sure that <tt/gracebat/
	  shows up in your path). Executing <tt/gracebat/ with no
	  command line parameters or data files will produce a
	  hardcopy on the default printer.

      <sect1>How can I input data in date/time formats?
	<p>

	  Currently, you can't.

	  The <url name="ISO8601 date format"
	  url="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html"> is
	  currently being implemented into Grace and should appear
          soon.
          
          Please use an external program to convert the data into the
          Julian Date format, like the one that is supplied with Grace.

      <sect1>What is the Julian Date?
	<p>

	  The Julian Date, not to be confused with the Julian
	  calendar, is a format to represent the time in a single
	  number. Julian Date 0 is a day way in the past, namely the
	  1st January 4713 before Christ (don't ask me why).  The
	  following days are numbered sequentially, each day starting
	  at noon.

	  This numbering scheme is in wide use, especially in
	  astronomy, and is used for the internal representation of
	  dates in Grace.

	  Look at the files <tt/jul2greg.c/ and <tt/greg2jul.c/ in
	  <tt>$GRACE_HOME/auxiliary/</tt>.

<!-- **************************************** -->

    <sect>Mathematics
      <p>

      <sect1>What algorithm is used for non-linear curve fitting?
	<p>

	  It is the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, based on LMDIF from
	  MINPACK, with some modifications.

<!-- **************************************** -->

    <sect>Miscellaneous
      <p>

      <sect1>Is Grace Year 2000 compliant?
	<p>

	  Yes. No warranty, of course. But as far as the treatment of
	  dates as data is concerned, years always have 4 digits. So
	  `98' is the year Trajan became Emperor of Rome, not 1998.

	  Concerning an overflow of the system clock: being UNIX
	  software, Grace uses a variable type called <tt/time_t/
	  (count of seconds since New Year's Day 1970) to represent
          time internally. On a 32-bit OS, this counter will overflow in early
          2038, or (depending on implementation) in the next century, and <bf/not/
          2000. By that time, for sure, everyone will be running a 64- or 
          higher- bit operating system, which would overflow in so distant
          future, that only cosmologists dare to think of it.

	  See also <url
	  url="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/y2k.html">.

      <sect1>Can Grace plot 3d graphs?
	<p>

	  No. Not yet, I should say. Be patient. It may take quite a
	  while to implement it, though.

      <sect1>Which features are planned for the future?
	<p>

	  Among the many features planned to be introduced in the
	  future are 3D plots, a spreadsheet-like frontend for set
	  operations, contour plots and XPM/JPEG/... image import and
	  manipulations.

      <sect1>Are there things that Grace can't do?
	<p>

	  Probably. If you have an idea for improvement, send mail to
	  the mailing list (question <ref id="mailinglist"
	  name="Mailing Lists">) or post it as a wish to the w3todo web
	  page (see question <ref id="w3todo" name="Known Bugs">).

      <sect1>What different kinds of sets can Grace plot?
	<p>

	  The standard set is the regular (x,y) set, but there are
	  others including error bars or descriptive strings. See the
	  User's Guide (question <ref id="manual" name="User's Guide">)
	  for details.

      <sect1>How do I make a Grace image fit on a given paper size?
	<p>

	  Select the correct paper size in the <tt/Device setup/
	  popup.

	  You can also try the command psresize from the <url
	  name="psutils package"
	  url="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/~ajcd/psutils/"> in order to
	  resize a postscript file generated by Grace.

<!-- **************************************** -->

    <sect>Runtime Errors
      <p>

      <sect1>When I start Grace I get the message ``can't find library libXXX.so'' or similar.
	<p>

	  For certain tasks, Grace needs external libraries which are
	  neither provided by Grace nor the operating system. You will
	  need to install these libraries yourself. This applies to
	  Motif (see question <ref id="motif" name="Motif">), PDF
	  (see question <ref id="export" name="Output Devices">)
	  and probably other libraries.

	<sect2>Can't find library libXm.so (on Linux)
	  <p>

	    If this message occurs, then you don't have Motif (the Xm
	    libraries, see question <ref id="motif" name="Motif">)
	    installed (see the question above), or the linker doesn't
	    know where it is. In the first case, try downloading
	    Lesstif. In the second case, you have to tell your linker
	    where it is. Look at the file <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt>. It
	    contains pathnames of the directories where dynamic
	    libraries are stored. Add (as root) your directory to this
	    file and run <tt>ldconfig -v</tt>. Now the libraries
	    should be in the list.

	    For some versions of Motif, the ``soname'' (which
	    identifies the version of the library and is stored
	    somewhere in the library) on your computer doesn't match
	    the soname of the library on the computer where your copy
	    of Grace was compiled on. Then you should use a
	    (semi)statically linked version or compile Grace on your
	    computer.

      <sect1>I get errors like "X Error of failed request: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)"
	<p>

	  This means that Grace made an incorrect access to an X
	  library. This is most probably not Grace's fault. Probably a
	  not-yet-correctly-implemented LessTif function (see question
	  <ref id="motif" name="Motif">) caused this behaviour. If you
	  use LessTif, try to get the latest version (see question
	  <ref id="motif" name="Motif">). If this error persists,
	  report it as a bug (question <ref id="w3todo" name="Bug
	    Reports">).

      <sect1>I run Grace and get the following error messages: Warning:
             translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfPageLeft
             Warning: ... found while parsing
             '&lt;Key>osfPageLeft:SWLeftPage()'
	<p>

	  Get the XKeySymDB file from the X11R6 distribution. Put it
	  somewhere where you can access it and set the <tt/XKEYSYMDB/
	  environment variable to
	  <tt>"/place/where/you/put/XKeysymDB"</tt>.  See question
	  <ref id="environment" name="Environment Variables"> on how
	  to set environment variables.

      <sect1>I run Grace on a Solaris 2.5.1 box, and when I try to open a file,
             I can't read the names of the files (files section of the dialog)
             because Grace writes ALL the path of each file in the list and
             there is no horizontal scroll.
	<p>

	  This is a known bug of Motif implementation on Solaris
	  2.5.1 (both Sparc and Intel hardware). Ask your vendor for a patch.

      <sect1>Grace cannot find font database and initialize the T1 library
	<p>
	  You have probably tried to run Grace without installing it,
	  just after compilation. You got the following message :

<tscreen><verb>
scanFontDBase(): Font Database
File not found T1_InitLib(): Fatal error scanning Font
Database File Initialization of t1-library failed!
</verb></tscreen>

          Grace uses either the <tt/GRACE_HOME/ environment variable
	  or a compiled in default path to find the font database. If
	  the variable is not set and you have not installed the
	  database with <tt/make install/ it cannot find it. If you
	  want to test Grace before installing it, you should set the
	  environment variable to the distribution directory (the one
	  where the file <tt/configure/ lies), this is what the
	  <tt/dotest/ script does when you run <tt/make check/. The
	  easiest thing to do however is to install everything with
	  <tt/make install/. See question <ref id="environment"
	  name="Environment Variables"> on how to set environment
	  variables.
          
          If you get this message after installing a prebuilt package,
          then you have either forgotten to download the platform-independent
          part of the installation (named like grace-x.y.zz.common.tar.gz) or
          not set the <tt/GRACE_HOME/ environment variable, see few lines 
          above.

      <sect1>When I include an EPS file generated by Grace into my (La)TeX
             document, the graphic hides some of the surrounding text.
	<p>
          
          LaTeX does not do hard clipping of EPS files unless instructed to do
          so. Use \includegraphics*{} and NOT \includegraphics{}. 

          The erasing comes about because Grace fills the background with the
          page size and not the bbox size. The background filling can be
          disabled from the "Plot/Plot appearance" popup.

      <sect1>Printing to my old PostScript printer produces an error.
	<p>
          
	  By default, the PS driver uses Level 2 features, while your
          printer may not be PostScript Level 2 compliant. You can force
          the use of PS Level 1 only features in the PostScript device setup,
          though output may be not exactly as expected (there will be no
          pattern fills, for example).

    <sect>Command Line Interface <label id="commands">
      <p>

      <sect1>Which non-interactive batch commands does Grace know?
	<p>

	  Lots. Almost every mouseclick in the GUI has an equivalent
	  in the batch language. See the User's Guide (question <ref
	  id="manual" name="User's Guide">) for details.

	  
      <sect1>How can I do feature extraction non-interactively?
	<p>

	  Currently not at all. This will be implemented in a later
	  release.

      <sect1>How can I use non-linear fits in the batch mode?
	<p>

	  Make a batch file with the following commands:
	  
	  <verb>
	    fit formula "y = a0 + a1 * sin (a2 + x * pi / 180)"
	    fit with 3 parameters
	    fit prec 0.05
	    a0 = 1
	    a0 constraints off
	    a1 = 1
	    a1 constraints off
	    a2 = 1
	    a2 constraints off
	    nonlfit (s0, 100)
	  </verb>

	  This assumes that your original curve is in set s0 and that
	  you want to make 100 iterations.

	  <tt/nonlfit()/ doesn't produce any plots by itself. It only
	  <bf/fits/. I.e., at this point, you can use the fitted
	  values <tt/A0, A1, A2.../:

	  Plot a set, e.g.:

	  <verb>
	    s3 on
	    s3 length s0.length
	    s3.x = s0.x
	    s3.y = a0 + a1 * sin (a2 + x * pi / 180)
	  </verb>

	  Use for another fit as the initial values, or just ECHO them
	  (to <tt/stdout/) with <tt/ECHO A0/.
