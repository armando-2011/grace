1. CONFIGURATION
   a) read README.configure for basic notes on the GNU configure usage
   b) extra libraries. Some features will be available only if additional
      libraries are installed. See README.FFTW, README.PDF and README.GIF
   c) run `./configure --help' to get list of additional switches specific to
      Grace
   d) run `./configure <options>'
      Just an example:
      ./configure --enable-grace-home=/opt/grace 
                  --enable-extra-incpath=/usr/local/include:/opt/include \
                  --enable-extra-ldpath=/usr/local/lib:/opt/lib --prefix=/usr
      
      would use
      /usr/local/include and /opt/include in addition to the default include
      path and /usr/local/lib and /opt/lib in addition to the default ld path.
      As well, all stuff would be put under the /opt/grace directory and soft
      links made to /usr/bin, /usr/lib and /usr/include.

      *** NOTE *** If you change one of the '--enable-extra-incpath' or
      '--enable-extra-ldpath' options from one run of configure to another,
      remember to delete the "config.cache" file!!!
   
      There is one configure switch which must be paid a special attention to: 
      `--enable-config'. Some pre-defined configurations exist: look in the
      `conf' direcory for the list. Some OS/hardware combinations have more than
      one configuration file - you'll have to use the switch to choose an
      alternative one.
   e) check config.h and Make.conf (produced by "configure")

2. COMPILING

   issue `make'

   If something goes wrong, try to see if the problem has been described
   already in the Grace FAQ (in the "doc" directory).

3. TESTING

   make tests

4. INSTALLATION

   make install
   make links
   
   The later (optional) step will make soft links from some files under the
   Grace home directory to the system-wide default locations (can be changed
   by the `--prefix' option at the 1.d step)
