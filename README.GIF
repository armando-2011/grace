Raster drivers (GIF/GD/PNM) use the GD-1.3 library of Thomas Boutell. The home
page of the library is http://www.boutell.com/gd/. Prior to the library
compilation, you must apply patch which can be found in the "patches" directory
of the Grace distribution tree; otherwise, complex polygons will be filled
incorrectly.

As of now, the following problems with the driver are known:

 * patterned fills of ellipses cause crash
 * only even-odd fill rule is supported
