PDF driver requires the PDFlib-0.6 library of Thomas Merz to be installed.
The PDFlib distribution is available at 
http://www.ifconnection.de/~tm/software/pdflib/index.html. Furthermore,
prior to the library compilation, you must apply patch which can be found
in the "patches" directory of the Grace distribution tree.

Please pay attention to the following: the library can be compiled with or
without support for TIFF images. If you enable the TIFF support (off by
default), make sure to uncomment the "define USE_TIFF" line at the top of
the pdfdrv.c file in the "src" directory of the Grace distribution tree.

As of now, the following problems with the driver are known:

 * patterned fills are not implemented
 * bitmapped text strings are not transparent
 * arcs of angles != 90*n are very roughly approximated
